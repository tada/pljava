<div class="block">Distribute your work as a self-extracting jar file by including one file,
 JarX.class, that also safely converts text files to the receiver's encoding
 and newline conventions, and adds less than 7 kB to your jar.
<P>
 A self-extracting file is handy if your recipient might have a
 Java runtime environment but not the jar tool.
 The text conversion offered by JarX is useful if your distribution will
 include text files, source, documentation, scripts, etc., and your recipients
 have platforms with different newline conventions.
<H2>Text conversion background</H2>
 There are two issues in the cross-platform delivery of text files.
<OL><LI>Different platforms indicate the end of a line differently.
 The UNIX convention uses the single character LINE FEED; the (old) Macintosh
 used only the CARRIAGE RETURN character, and DOS/Windows systems require
 every line to end with a CARRIAGE RETURN followed by a LINE FEED.
 If some conversion isn't done, a Windows file appears to have garbage
 characters at the ends of lines if moved to UNIX, or the beginnings of lines
 if moved to a Mac; UNIX and Mac files moved to Windows, or Mac files moved
 to UNIX, appear to be squished into one insanely long line.
 These effects can complicate viewing and editing the files, and interfere
 with automated processes like diff or version control.
<LI>Different platforms may use different default character encodings.
 Ideally, text files within a jar should be extracted into the local encoding.
</OL><P>
 It's important to apply such transformations <EM>only</EM> to the files
 within the archive that are actually <EM>known</EM> to contain text.
 Passing binary data or class files through character and newline
 transformations will corrupt them.
<H3>The ZIP approach and why it loses</H3>
 The popular zip format on which jar is based already has a provision for
 newline (but not character set) conversion. Each entry includes a text/binary
 bit, and the unzip program applies newline conversion while extracting, but
 only to the files flagged as text.
<P>
 One problem, though not the fatal one, with this scheme is that there is no
 single convention for newlines inside the zip file.  Instead, files are
 stored just as they are found on the source system, and a code indicating the
 source operating system is stored in the archive.  The receiving unzip
 program must interpret the code and know what newline convention that
 operating system used, in order to convert newlines appropriately.
<P>
 The fatal flaw, however, has to do with the way the text/binary
 bit gets set in the first place.  While building the archive, the common zip
 programs look at statistical properties of byte frequencies in the input,
 and set the text bit for any entry that looks like it might be text!  If a
 binary file happens to contain an unlucky sequence of bytes, it will be
 flagged as text and then silently corrupted by any unzip program that honors
 the text bit.  That can happen, and has happened, to class files in zip
 archives if the recipient uses unzip -a, and causes significant misery if
 the package is widely distributed.
<H3>A better way</H3>
 Even though the jar format is based on zip, it would be a mistake to make jar
 tools that rely on the zip text/binary bit, because common
 practice has made that bit unreliable.  What's needed is a standard way for
 the developer to explicitly indicate the processing needed for each entry
 in the jar.  Also, a single representation should be adopted for newlines
 in text files inside a jar, so an extracting program only needs to convert
 from that representation to the local one, and does not need to concern
 itself with details of the system where the jar was created.
<P>
 As of JDK 1.3, Sun has extended the
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Per-Entry%20Attributes">
Jar File Specification</A> to allow a <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> in the
 Manifest for each jar entry.  The value of <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> is a
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">MIME
 type</A>, and with this a developer can specify exactly which entries in a
 jar should be treated as text.  The question of a standard representation
 for newlines inside the jar is settled, because
 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2046.txt">[RFC2046 section 4.1.1]</A>
 establishes a canonical line break representation for all subtypes of the
 <CODE>text</CODE> MIME type.  Therefore, correct translation of line breaks from any
 platform to any platform can be achieved if a jar-building program just
 converts from its local convention to the canonical CRLF form, and a jar
 extraction program just converts the canonical to its own local form. Neither
 program needs to know anything about the other environment.
 Finally, the <CODE>charset</CODE> parameter of the <CODE>text</CODE> type
 allows explicit specification of the character encoding used in a jar entry,
 and the extracting program can automatically convert into the encoding used
 on the local system. (But see <STRONG>Call to action</STRONG> below.)
<H2>What JarX Does</H2>
 <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> entries in a Manifest were introduced in Java 1.3
 but are compatible with earlier jar specifications; a jar file containing
 such entries can be processed without any trouble by any jar tool compliant
 with the old or new standard.  However, there is not yet a full jar tool
 available that will honor the content types and do automatic transformation
 of text entries.  To fill the need until that functionality is added to the
 widely-available jar tools, JarX is available now.
<P>
 JarX.Build produces a jar, working from a manifest file prepared by the
 developer.  Entries with any <CODE>text</CODE> type will be translated from
 the local encoding into the specified <CODE>charset</CODE> if given, and
 entries with the specific type <CODE>text/plain</CODE> will have their line
 endings converted to the CRLF canonical form.  Line endings are left alone
 for all other subtypes of <CODE>text</CODE>, but this decision is open to
 comment.
<P>
 The file produced by JarX.Build is a fully compliant jar and can be unpacked
 by any jar or unzip tool, but current tools will not automatically convert
 the text files to the local conventions.  By including the single class file
 <CODE>JarX.class</CODE> in the jar, a developer produces a self-extracting
 archive that can be executed to unpack itself on any Java 1.6 or later
 virtual machine, performing all automatic conversions and requiring no jar
 tool at all.
<H2>Building a Jar</H2>
 To build a jar file, first prepare the manifest, using any text editor or,
 more likely, a script.  Include a <CODE>Name:</CODE> entry for every file
 to be included in the jar.  JarX.Build archives only the files named in
 the manifest.  Be sure to include <CODE>Manifest-Version: 1.0</CODE> as
 the first line of the manifest; JarX.Build does not do it for you.  To make
 the jar self-extracting, make the next line<BR>
 <CODE>Main-Class: org.gjt.cuspy.JarX</CODE><BR> and be sure to include a
 <CODE>Name:</CODE> entry for <CODE>org/gjt/cuspy/JarX.class</CODE>.
<P>
 Add an appropriate <CODE>Content-Type:</CODE> line after the
 <CODE>Name:</CODE> line for every entry that needs one.  JarX itself only
 distinguishes the <CODE>text</CODE> types from nontext (everything else),
 and treats a missing <CODE>Content-Type:</CODE> as nontext, so for purposes
 of JarX you only need to add content types for text files.  For other
 purposes you may wish to include the types of other entries as well.
 In the simplest case, just omit content types for your non-text files,
 and add <CODE>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8</CODE> for files that
 you want auto-converted.  Then give the command<BR>
 <CODE>java org.gjt.cuspy.JarX$Build foo.jar manifest</CODE><BR> if
 <CODE>manifest</CODE> is the name of your prepared manifest file and
 <CODE>foo.jar</CODE> names the jar you want to create.
 The order of files in the jar will be the order of their names in the
 manifest.
<H3>Special manifest attributes</H3>
 For 2016, JarX now recognizes some special manifest attributes:
 <DL>
  <DT>_JarX_CharsetInArchive</DT>
  <DD>As a per-entry attribute, identifies the character set of the associated
   text member as stored in the archive. This is entirely equivalent to the
   earlier method using <code>;charset=</code> on the Content-Type attribute,
   which JarX still supports, but has not been widely adopted. As a main
   attribute, sets a default for any text members without a per-entry value.
  </DD>
  <DT>_JarX_CharsetWhenUnpacked</DT>
  <DD>As a per-entry attribute, identifies the character set of the associated
   text member when not in the archive. At Build time, the member will be
   transcoded from this charset (instead of the platform's default) to the
   specified InArchive charset, and, on extraction, will be transcoded back
   to this charset regardless of the platform's default encoding. This
   attribute can be used for files conforming to specifications that define
   a fixed encoding. In other cases, omitting this attribute allows the
   member to be extracted into the receiving platform's default charset.
   As a main attribute, sets a default for text members without a per-entry
   value.</DD>
  <DT>_JarX_Permissions</DT>
  <DD>As a per-entry attribute, declares permissions to apply to the
   extracted file. (At present, not applied to directories.) Only the
   Java SE 6 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.io" class="externalLink"><code>File</code></a> permissions are supported, a small subset
   of what most platforms support. A comma-separated list of
   <em>usage</em><code>=</code><em>bywhom</em>, where <em>usage</em> can be
   <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, or <code>execute</code> and <em>bywhom</em> can be
   <code>none</code>, <code>owner</code>, or <code>all</code>. As a main attribute, sets a
   default for members without a per-entry attribute. For any <em>usage</em>
   that is left unspecified, no <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.io" class="externalLink"><code>File</code></a> method will be
   called to change that permission, so the system's defaults will apply.
  </DD>
  <DT>_JarX_PathResolver</DT>
  <DD>Only recognized as a main attribute, this specifies a script that JarX
   will invoke for every archive member, with the following bindings in scope:
    <DL>
     <DT>properties</DT><DD>The Java system Properties object.</DD>
     <DT>storedPath</DT><DD>The full pathname of the member, exactly as
      stored in the archive.</DD>
     <DT>platformPath</DT><DD>The full pathname after only replacing the
      <code>/</code> separator character with the platform's <code>file.separator</code>
      if different.
     </DD>
     <DT>computedPath</DT><DD>Initially the same as <code>platformPath</code>.
      If the script stores a new value in <code>computedPath</code>, the member
      will be extracted to that full path.</DD>
    </DL>
   The script is given as the value of this attribute, using the same
   RFC822-ish lexical conventions the jar spec says it was "inspired by".
   The value must begin with a MIME type (two atoms separated by a slash,
   as in <code>application/javascript</code>, followed by at least one
   <code>QUOTEDSTRING</code>. RFC822 uses the double-quote for this purpose, and
   backslash to escape it when needed, which also means you must double any
   backslash intended for the script. Additional <code>QUOTEDSTRING</code>s simply
   append to the script. The RFC822 line-continuation rule can be exploited
   by supplying the script as multiple quoted strings, one per line, each
   indented by a space. The strings are appended with nothing in between
   (so, the continuation newlines do not become newlines in the script), but
   a <code>/</code> can appear between any two quoted strings to insert an
   explicit newline in the script. In addition to whatever comment syntax is
   allowed in the scripting language, RFC822 comments (marked by parentheses,
   and nestable) are allowed outside of the quoted strings.
  </DD>
 </DL>
<H3>Alternative to <code>ScriptEngine</code> for a path resolver</H3>
 With the removal of Nashorn in Java 15, leaving no scripting language that
 can be assumed present in the Java runtime, a script in the manifest may
 no longer be the simplest way to customize the resolution of path names when
 extracting. This class has been refactored now to expose two methods,
 <a href="#prepareResolver(java.lang.String)"><code>prepareResolver</code></a> and
 <a href="#resolve(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)"><code>resolve</code></a>, easily overridden in a subclass.
 The value of the <code>_JarX_PathResolver</code> main attribute is passed to
 <code>prepareResolver</code> as a string (so it can be parsed in any way useful to
 the subclass, not necessarily as described above, or ignored), and
 <code>resolve</code> is passed the stored path and platform path, and returns the
 platform path unchanged or a replacement. A self-extracting jar with
 resolution can be made without depending on any script engine, by placing
 <em>two</em> classes in the jar, JarX and the subclass, and naming the
 subclass as the jar's <code>Main-Class</code>. It needs a <code>main</code> method that
 simply instantiates the class and calls <code>extract()</code>.
<H2>Extracting a jar</H2>
 The command <CODE>java -jar foo.jar</CODE> is all it takes
 to extract a jar.  The <CODE>Main-Class</CODE> entry in the manifest
 identifies the entry point of JarX so it does not need to be specified.
<H2>Call to action</H2>
 At the moment, Sun's Jar File Specification contains a mistake in the
 description of a content type that could lead to implementations
 that reject valid content types.  Squash this bug before it bites:
 log on to the
<A HREF="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/">Java Developer
 Connection</A> (it's free) and cast one, two, or all three of your Bug Votes
 for

Bug #4310708</A>.
<H2>Miscellany</H2>
 This class is a little sloppy and relatively slow, especially the Build side
 when converting plain text files.  The idea for JarX is a natural outgrowth
 of the Java 1.3 manifest standard and I have suggested that the functionality
 of JarX be added into the widely available jar tools.  If Sun takes the
 suggestion then the functionality of JarX will soon be provided by nice
 fast optimized tools and it won't be necessary to spend a lot of time
 polishing JarX.
<P>
 Error handling is roughly nonexistent.  JarX is careful to avoid silent
 corruption of data, even verifying that all character encoding calls are
 successful, but makes no attempt to be graceful about errors or surprises.
 If something doesn't work the likely result is a one line message and abrupt
 exit, or an uncaught exception and stack trace.
<P>
 The coding style is a little contrived just to arrange it so JarX.class is
 the only file needed in the jar to make it self-extracting.  In particular
 the JarX class is also written to serve as the class of tokens returned by
 the structured-field-body lexer, to avoid introducing a second class.  Weird,
 perhaps, but harmless weird.</div>
