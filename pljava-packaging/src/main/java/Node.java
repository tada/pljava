/**
 * Extends the JarX extraction tool to provide a {@code resolve} method that
 * replaces prefixes {@code pljava/foo/} in path names stored in the archive
 * with the result of {@code pg_config --foo}.
 *<p>
 * As this represents a second extra {@code .class} file that has to be added
 * to the installer jar anyway, it will also contain some methods intended to be
 * useful for tasks related to installation and testing. The idea is not to go
 * overboard, but supply a few methods largely modeled on the most basic ones of
 * PostgreSQL's {@code PostgreSQL::Test::Cluster} Perl module (formerly named
 * {@code PostgresNode}, from which the name of this class was taken). The
 * methods can be invoked from {@code jshell} if its classpath includes the
 * installer jar (and one of the PostgreSQL JDBC drivers).
 *<p>
 * An
 * <a href="../../../../../../develop/node.html">introduction with examples</a>
 * is available.
 *<p>
 * Unlike the many capabilities of {@code PostgreSQL::Test::Cluster}, this only
 * deals in TCP sockets bound to {@code localhost}
 * ({@code StandardProtocolFamily.UNIX}
 * finally arrived in Java 16 but this class does not support it yet) and only
 * a few of the most basic operations.
 *<p>
 * As in JarX itself, some liberties with coding style may be taken here to keep
 * this one extra {@code .class} file from proliferating into a bunch of them.
 *<p>
 * As the testing-related methods here are intended for ad-hoc or scripted use
 * in {@code jshell}, they are typically declared to throw any checked
 * exception, without further specifics. There are many overloads of methods
 * named {@code q} and {@code qp} (mnemonic of query and query-print), to make
 * interactive use in {@code jshell} comfortable with just a few static imports.

	 *<p>
	 * Treats the list of lambdas as a set of consecutively-numbered states
	 * (the first in the list is state number 1, and is the initial state).
	 * At each step of the machine, the current state is applied to the current
	 * input object, and may return an {@code Integer} or a {@code Boolean}.
	 *<p>
	 * If an integer, its absolute value selects the next state. A positive
	 * integer consumes the current input item, so the next state will be
	 * applied to the next item of input. A negative integer transitions to the
	 * selected next state without consuming the current input item, so it will
	 * be examined again in the newly selected state.
	 *<p>
	 * If boolean, {@code false} indicates that the machine cannot proceed; the
	 * supplied <em>reporter</em> will be passed an explanatory string and this
	 * method returns false. A state that returns {@code true} indicates the
	 * machine has reached an accepting state.
	 *<p>
	 * No item of input is allowed to be null; null is reserved to be the
	 * end-of-input symbol. If a state returns {@code true} (accept)
	 * when applied to null at the end of input, the machine has matched and
	 * this method returns true. A state may also return a negative integer in
	 * this case, to shift to another state while looking at the end of input.
	 * A positive integer (attempting to consume the end of input), or a false,
	 * return will cause an explanatory message to the <em>reporter</em> and a
	 * false return from this method.
	 *<p>
	 * A state may return {@code true} (accept) when looking at a non-null
	 * input item, but the input will be checked to confirm it has no more
	 * elements. Otherwise, the machine has tried to accept before matching
	 * all the input, and this method will return false.
	 *<p>
	 * To avoid defining a new functional interface, each state is represented
	 * by {@link InvocationHandler}, an existing functional interface with a
	 * versatile argument list and permissive {@code throws} clause. Each state
	 * must be represented as a lambda with three parameters (the convention
	 * {@code (o,p,q)} is suggested), of which only the first is normally used.
	 * If Java ever completes the transition to {@code _} as an unused-parameter
	 * marker, the suggested convention will be {@code (o,_,_)}, unless the
	 * third (<var>q</var>) is also needed for special purposes (more below).
	 *<p>
	 * As the input item passed to each state is typed {@code Object}, and as
	 * null can only represent the end of input, it may be common for a state to
	 * both cast an input to an expected type and confirm it is not null.
	 * The {@link #as as} method combines those operations. If its argument
	 * either is null or cannot be cast to the wanted type, {@code as} will
	 * throw a specific instance of {@code ClassCastException}, which will be
	 * treated, when caught by {@code stateMachine}, just as if the state
	 * had returned {@code false}.
	 *<p>
	 * The third parameter to an {@code InvocationHandler} is an {@code Object}
	 * array, and is here used to pass additional information that may at times
	 * be of use in a state. The first element of the array holds the boxed form
	 * of the current (1-based) state number. As a state must indicate the next
	 * state by returning an absolute state number, having the state's own
	 * number available opens the possibility of reusable presupplied state
	 * implementations that do not depend on their absolute position.
	 * @param name A name for this state machine, used only in exception
	 * messages if it fails to match all the input
	 * @param reporter a Consumer to accept a diagnostic string if the machine
	 * fails to match, defaulting if null to {@code System.err::println}
	 * @param input A Stream of input items, of which none may be null
