# Finding the files produced by a PL/Java build

The PL/Java [build process][bld] using `mvn clean package` produces files
needed to install the language in PostgreSQL, which need to be copied to
appropriate permanent locations, and their pathnames may have to be set
in `pljava.*` variables, as the [installation page][inst] describes.

They are produced in different locations in the build tree and their
exact names can depend on platform and version details, so these tips
may help in finding them.

[inst]: install.html

$h2 The packaged tar or zip file

The `packaging` subproject builds a single `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file
(depending on the platform where the build is done). Relative to the
root of the build tree, it is found at

`packaging/target/pljava-${pgversion}-${naraol}.tar.gz` (or `.zip`)

where `${pgversion}` resembles `pg9.4` and `${naraol}` is an
*architecture-os-linker* triple, for example `amd64-Linux-gpp`
or `amd64-Windows-msvc`. It contains these things:

`pljava/pljava.jar`
: The architecture-independent, Java portion of the PL/Java implementation
    (more below).

`pljava/pljava.so` (or `.dll`, etc.)
: The architecture-dependent, native library portion of the PL/Java
    implementation (more below).

`pljava/examples.jar`
: A set of [examples demonstrating PL/Java usage][examples], usable also
    as rudimentary tests.

`pljava/docs.tar`
: A collection of historical-interest and design documents from the origins
    of PL/Java.

`pljava/install.sql`, `pljava/uninstall.sql`
: _Deprecated_ In normal circumstances, these are no longer needed to install
    or uninstall PL/Java.

`pljava/deploy.jar`
: _Deprecated_ In normal circumstances, this tool is no longer needed to install
    or uninstall PL/Java.

[examples]: ../examples/examples.html

Extract the needed files from this archive and place them in appropriate
locations, then complete the [installation][inst].

$h2 Naming the built files directly

When the only purpose is to quickly check the built PL/Java, it is faster
not to extract files from the packaged archive into some other location,
but simply to `SET` the `pljava.*` variables to point to the files right
where they were generated in the build tree.

$h3 The architecture-independent PL/Java `jar` file

This file is built by the `pljava` subproject,
so relative to the source root where the build was
done, it will be found in `pljava/target/pljava-\${project.version}.jar`
with `\${project.version}` replaced in the obvious way,
for example `${project.version}`.

$h3 The architecture-dependent PL/Java native library

This is built by the `pljava-so` subproject. Its filename extension can depend
on the operating system: `.so` on many systems, `.dll` on Windows, `.bundle` on
Mac OS X / Darwin. Relative to the source root where the build was performed, it
is at the end of a long and redundant path that contains the project version
(twice), an "architecture-OS-linker" string (twice), and a build type
("plugin"), also twice.

An example, for version `${project.version}` and arch-os-linker of
`amd64-Linux-gpp` is (very deep breath):

`pljava-so/target/nar/pljava-so-${project.version}-amd64-Linux-gpp-shared/lib/amd64-Linux-gpp/shared/libpljava-so-${project.version}.so`
