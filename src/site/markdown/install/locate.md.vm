# Finding the files produced by a PL/Java build

The PL/Java [build process][bld] using `mvn clean install` produces files
needed to install the language in PostgreSQL, which need to be copied to
appropriate permanent locations, and their pathnames may have to be set
in `pljava.*` variables, as the [installation page][inst] describes.

They are produced in different locations in the build tree and their
exact names can depend on platform and version details, so these tips
may help in finding them.

$h2 The packaged jar file

The `pljava-packaging` subproject builds a single `.jar` file.
At one time, it was in the business of trying to decide whether Windows,
Unix, or Mac users would like `.zip` or `.tar.gz` files better, but if you
are planning to use PL/Java then you certainly have Java around, and can
work with a `.jar` file no matter what.

Relative to the root of the build tree, the jar file is found at

`pljava-packaging/target/pljava-${pgversion}.jar`

where `${pgversion}` resembles `pg16`. The jar contains these things:

`pljava/pkglibdir/libpljava-\${project.version}.so` (or `.dll`, etc.)
: The architecture-dependent, native library portion of the PL/Java
    implementation (more below). The name might end in `.so` or `.dll`
    or `.bundle` or something else, and might or might not start with `lib`.

`pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava-\${project.version}.jar`
: The architecture-independent, Java portion of the PL/Java implementation
    (more below).

`pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava-api-\${project.version}.jar`
: The jar file that should be named on the `javac` module path when compiling
    code for PL/Java (see "How to compile against the PL/Java API" in the
    [user guide][use]).

`pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava-examples-\${project.version}.jar`
: A set of [examples demonstrating PL/Java usage][examples], usable also
    as rudimentary tests.

`pljava/sharedir/extension/pljava.control`
: The file that tells `CREATE EXTENSION` what's what.

`pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava--*.sql`
: Various files scripting what `CREATE EXTENSION` or
    `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` really do.

`pljava/sysconfdir/pljava.policy`
: Policy file defining the Java permissions granted to the languages `java`
    and `javaU`, to any custom language aliases, or to specific jars, as
    described [here][policy].

It could happen that future versions add more files in the jar before
updating this page. Also, every jar file has a `MANIFEST.MF`, and this
file also contains a `JarX.class` to make it self-extracting; these are
not otherwise important to PL/Java. See the [installation page][inst]
for how to control the self-extraction.

Another file, `Node.class`, present in this jar is also unimportant for
normal installation, but provides some facilities for automated testing,
as described [here][node].

[examples]: ../examples/examples.html
[node]: ../develop/node.html
[policy]: ../use/policy.html

Extract the needed files from this archive and place them in appropriate
locations, then complete the [installation][inst].

$h2 Naming the built files directly

When the only purpose is to quickly check the built PL/Java, it may be faster
not to extract files from the packaged archive into some other location,
but simply to `SET` the `pljava.*` variables to point to the files right
where they were generated in the build tree.

$h3 The PL/Java API `jar` file

This file is built by the `pljava-api` subproject,
so relative to the source root where the build was
done, it will be found in `pljava-api/target/pljava-api-\${project.version}.jar`
with `\${project.version}` replaced in the obvious way,
for example `${project.version}`.

This file needs to be named in `pljava.module_path` along with the internals
`jar` file below. If convenient, check the default value of `pljava.module_path`
and place both these files where it expects them to be; then it will not need
to be set.

$h3 The architecture-independent PL/Java `jar` file

This file is built by the `pljava` subproject,
so relative to the source root where the build was
done, it will be found in `pljava/target/pljava-\${project.version}.jar`
with `\${project.version}` replaced in the obvious way,
for example `${project.version}`.

In the simplest installation, determine the default value of
`pljava.module_path` and place the jar file at that exact name, alongside
the PL/Java API jar described above.
In a typical distribution, the default will be
`$sharedir/pljava/pljava-\${project.version}.jar`.

$h3 The architecture-dependent PL/Java native library

This is built by the `pljava-so` subproject. Its filename extension can depend
on the operating system: `.so` on many systems, `.dll` on Windows, `.bundle` on
Mac OS X / Darwin. Relative to the source root where the build was performed, it
is found in the `pljava-so/pljava-pgxs` directory.

An example for version `${project.version}` is:

`pljava-so/pljava-pgxs/libpljava-so-${project.version}.so`
