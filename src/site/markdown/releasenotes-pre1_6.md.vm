$h2 PL/Java 1.5.8

1.5.8 adds support for PostgreSQL 14, fixes two bugs, and begins preparation
for the impact of changes to Java's permission enforcement coming in Java 17
and later with JEP 411.

$h3 PL/Java with Java 17 and later: JEP 411

Current versions of PL/Java rely on Java security features that will be affected
by JEP 411, beginning with Java 17. Java 17 itself will continue to provide the
needed capabilities, with only deprecation marks and warnings added. Java 17 is
also positioned as a long-term support release, so the option of continuing to
run a current (1.5.8 or latest 1.6) PL/Java release without loss of function
will be available, if needed, by continuing to run with Java 17.

The PL/Java 1.5 series has had a good run, and is not expected to receive
backports of future, post-JEP 411 functionality.

For more on how PL/Java will adapt, please read about [JEP 411][jep411] on
the PL/Java wiki.

$h3 Bugs fixed

* [MalformedInputException: Input length = 1 in 1.5](${ghbug}340)

    The bug was exercised in a database where `server_encoding` was `SQL_ASCII`.
    The more-principled treatment of `SQL_ASCII` in PL/Java 1.6 has been
    backported, and is described [here][sqlascii].

* [Crash in autovacuum if a PL/Java functional index exists](${ghbug}355)

    Functional indexes over PL/Java functions can now be autovacuumed
    in PG 9.5 or later. In earlier versions, a `feature_not_supported` error
    will be reported instead of crashing. That can be avoided by setting the
    `autovacuum_enabled` storage parameter to `false` on any table having
    a Java-based functional index, and running explicit `VACUUM` periodically
    on such tables. Prior to PG 8.4, there was no such per-table setting, and
    the only workaround would be to forego autovacuum database-wide and use
    explicit `VACUUM` on some schedule.

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.7 (16 November 2020)

1.5.7 is a bug-fix release, with a single issue backpatched from the 1.6
branch, correcting a problem in XML Schema validation in some non-`en_US`
locales.

$h3 Bugs fixed

$h3 Credits

Thanks to Christoph Berg for the report.

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.6 (4 October 2020)

This release adds support for PostgreSQL 13.

It includes improvements to the JDBC 4.0 `java.sql.SQLXML` API that first became
available in 1.5.1, an update of the ISO SQL/XML examples based on the Saxon
product to Saxon 10 (which now includes support for XML Query higher-order
functions in the freely-licensed Saxon-HE), some improvements to internals,
and a number of bug fixes.

$h3 Version compatibility

PL/Java 1.5.6 can be built against recent PostgreSQL versions including 13,
and older ones back to 8.2, using Java SE 8 or later. The source code avoids
features newer than Java 6, so building with Java 7 or 6 should also be
possible, but is no longer routinely tested. The Java version used at runtime
does not have to be the same version used for building. PL/Java itself can run
on any Java version 6 or later if built with Java 11 or earlier; it can run
on Java 7 or later if built with Java 12 or later. PL/Java functions can be
written for, and use features of, whatever Java version will be loaded at run
time. See [version compatibility][versions] for more detail.

PL/Java 1.5.6 cannot be built with Java 15 or later, as the Nashorn JavaScript
engine used in the build process no longer ships with Java 15. It can be built
with [GraalVM][], if `-Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat` is added to the `mvn`
command line. It will run on Java 15 if built with an earlier JDK or with Graal.

When used with GraalVM as the runtime VM, PL/Java functions can use Graal's
"polyglot" capabilities to execute code in any other language available on
GraalVM. In this release, it is not yet possible to directly declare a function
in a language other than Java.

$h3 Changes

$h4 Improvements to the `java.sql.SQLXML` type

Additions to the `Adjusting.XML` API support
[limiting resource usage][xmlreslim] in XML processing, controlling
[resolution][xmlresolv] of external documents and resources,
[validation against a schema][xmlschema], and integration of an
[XML catalog][xmlcatalog] to locally satisfy requests for external documents.

Corrections and new documentation of [whitespace handling][xmlws] in XML values
of `CONTENT` form, and implementation [limitations][xmlimpl].

$h4 Improvements to the Saxon-based ISO SQL/XML example functions

Updated the dependency for these optional examples to Saxon 10. Probably the
most significant of the [Saxon 10 changes][saxon10], for PostgreSQL's purposes,
will be that the XQuery [higher-order function feature][xqhof] is now included
in the freely-licensed Saxon-HE, so that it is now possible without cost to
integrate a modern XQuery 3.1 implementation that is lacking only the
[schema-aware feature][xqsaf] and the [typed data feature][xqtdf] (for those,
the paid Saxon-EE product is needed), and the [static typing feature][xqstf]
(which is not in any Saxon edition).

To compensate for delivering the higher-order function support in -HE,
Saxonica moved certain optimizations to -EE. This seems a justifiable trade, as
it is better for development purposes to have the more complete implementation
of the language, leaving better optimization to be bought if and when needed.

Thanks to a tip from Saxon's developer, the returning of results to SQL is now
done in a way that may incur less copying in some cases.

$h4 Internals

* Many sources of warnings reported by the Java VM's `-Xcheck:jni` option have
    been tracked down, making it practical to use `-Xcheck:jni` in testing.
* Reduced pressure on the garbage collector in management of references to
    PostgreSQL native state.

$h3 Enhancement requests addressed

* Work around PostgreSQL [API breakage in EnterpriseDB 11](${ghbug}260)

$h3 Bugs fixed

* [Support of arrays in composite types](${ghbug}300)
* [Order-dependent behavior caching array types](${ghbug}310)
* [Date conversion errors possible with PostgreSQL 10 on Windows/MSVC](${ghbug}297)
* [Build issue with Windows/MinGW-w64](${ghbug}282)
* ["xmltable" with XML output column or parameter](${ghbug}280)
* [Google Summer of Code catches 15-year-old PL/Java bug](${ghbug}274)
* [Several bugs in SQLXML handling](${ghbug}272)
* Work around an exception from `Reference.clear` on OpenJ9 JVM
* Bugs in SQL generator when supplying a function parameter name, or the
    `category`, `delimiter`, or `storage` attribute of a user-defined type.

$h3 Updated PostgreSQL APIs tracked

* Removal of `CREATE EXTENSION ... FROM unpackaged`
* `numvals` in `SPITupleTable`
* `detoast.h`
* `detoast_external_attr`

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.5 (4 November 2019)

This bug-fix release fixes runtime issues reported in 32-bit `i386` builds, some
of which would not affect a more common 64-bit architecture, but some of which
could under the wrong circumstances, so this release should be used in
preference to 1.5.4 or 1.5.3 on any architecture.

It is featurewise identical to 1.5.4, so those release notes, below, should be
consulted for the details of user-visible changes.

Thanks to Christoph Berg for the `i386` testing that exposed these issues.

$h3 Bugs fixed

* [32bit i386 segfault](${ghbug}246)

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.4 (29 October 2019)

This minor release fixes a build issue reported with Java 11, and adds
support for building with Java 13. Issues with building the javadocs in later
Java versions are resolved. A work-in-progress feature that can
[apply the SQLXML API to other tree-structured data types](use/xmlview.html)
is introduced.

Documentation updates include coverage of
[changes to Application Class Data Sharing](install/appcds.html) in recent
Hotspot versions, and ahead-of-time compilation using
[jaotc](install/vmoptions.html#a-XX:AOTLibrary).

Otherwise, the release notes for 1.5.3, below, should be
consulted for the details of recent user-visible changes.

$h3 Bugs fixed

* [Build failure with Java 11 and --release](${ghbug}235)
* [Build with Java 13](${ghbug}236)
* [Javadoc build fails in Java 11+](${ghbug}239)
* [Javadoc build fails in Java 13](${ghbug}241)

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.3 (4 October 2019)

This release adds support for PostgreSQL 12, and removes the former
requirement to build with a Java release earlier than 9.

It includes a rework of of threading and resource management, improvements to
the JDBC 4.0 `java.sql.SQLXML` API that first became available in 1.5.1, and
a substantially usable example providing the functionality of ISO SQL
`XMLEXISTS`, `XMLQUERY`, `XMLTABLE`, `XMLCAST`, `LIKE_REGEX`,
`OCCURRENCES_REGEX`, `POSITION_REGEX`, `SUBSTRING_REGEX`, and `TRANSLATE_REGEX`.
Some bugs are fixed.

$h3 Version compatibility

PL/Java 1.5.3 can be built against recent PostgreSQL versions including 12,
and older ones back to 8.2, using Java SE 8 or later. The source code avoids
features newer than Java 6, so building with Java 7 or 6 should also be
possible, but is no longer routinely tested. The Java version used at runtime
does not have to be the same version used for building. PL/Java itself can run
on any Java version 6 or later if built with Java 11 or earlier; it can run
on Java 7 or later if built with Java 12. PL/Java functions can be written for,
and use features of, whatever Java version will be loaded at run time. See
[version compatibility][versions] for more detail.

When used with [GraalVM][] as the runtime VM, PL/Java functions can use its
"polyglot" capabilities to execute code in any other language available on
GraalVM. In this release, it is not yet possible to directly declare a function
in a language other than Java.

$h3 Changes

$h4 Threading/synchronization, finalizers, and new configuration variable

Java is multithreaded while PostgreSQL is not, requiring ways to prevent
Java threads from entering PostgreSQL at the wrong times, while cleaning up
native resources in PostgreSQL when PL/Java references are released, and
_vice versa_.

PL/Java has historically used an assortment of approaches including Java
object finalizers, which have long been deprecated informally, and formally
since Java 9. Finalizers enter PostgreSQL from a thread of their own, and the
synchronization approach used in PL/Java 1.5.2 and earlier has been associated
with occasional hangs at backend exit when using an OpenJ9 JVM at runtime.

A redesigned approach using a new `DualState` class was introduced in 1.5.1,
at first only used in implementing the `java.sql.SQLXML` type, a newly-added
feature. In 1.5.3, other approaches used in the rest of PL/Java's code base are
migrated to use `DualState` also, and all uses of the deprecated Java object
finalizers have been retired. With the new techniques, the former occasional
OpenJ9 hangs have not been observed.

This represents the most invasive change to PL/Java's thread synchronization
in many years, so it may be worthwhile to reserve extra time for
testing applications.

A new [configuration variable](use/variables.html),
`pljava.java_thread_pg_entry`, allows adjusting the thread policy. The default
setting, `allow`, preserves PL/Java's former behavior, allowing Java threads
entry into PostgreSQL one at a time, only when any thread already in PG code
has entered or returned to Java.

With object finalizers no longer used, PL/Java itself does not need the `allow`
mode, but there may be application code that does. Application code can be
tested by setting the `error` mode, which will raise an error for any attempted
entry to PG from a thread other than the original thread that launched PL/Java.
If an application runs in `error` mode with no errors, it can also be run in
`block` mode, which may be more efficient, as it eliminates many locking
operations that happen in `allow` or `error` mode. However, if `block` mode
is used with an application that has not been fully tested in `error` mode
first, and the application does attempt to enter PostgreSQL from a Java thread
other than the initial one, the result can be blocked threads or a deadlocked
backend that has to be killed.

A JMX management client like `JConsole` or `jvisualvm` can identify threads that
are blocked, if needed. The new `DualState` class also offers some statistics
that can be viewed in `JConsole`, or `jvisualvm` with the `VisualVM-MBeans`
plugin.

$h4 Improvements to the `java.sql.SQLXML` type

Support for this JDBC 4.0 type was added in PL/Java 1.5.1. Release 1.5.3
includes the following improvements:

* A new ["Adjusting" API](use/sqlxml.html#Extended_API_to_configure_XML_parsers)
    exposes configuration settings for Java XML parsers that may be created
    internally during operations on `SQLXML` instances. That allows the default
    settings to restrict certain XML parser features as advocated by the
    [Open Web Application Security Project][OWASP] when XML content may be
    coming from untrusted sources, with a simple API for relaxing those
    restrictions when appropriate for XML content from a known source.
* It is now possible for a PL/Java function to return, pass into a
    `PreparedStatement`, etc., an `SQLXML` instance that PL/Java did not create.
    For example, a PL/Java function could use another database's JDBC driver to
    obtain a `SQLXML` value from that database, and use that as its own return
    value. Transparently, the content is copied to a PL/Java `SQLXML` instance.
    The copy can also be done explicitly, allowing the "Adjusting" API to be
    used if the default XML parser restrictions should be relaxed.
* Behavior when the server encoding is not UTF-8, or when it is not an
    IANA-registered encoding (even if Java has a codec for it), has been
    improved.

$h4 Improvements to the Saxon-based ISO SQL/XML example functions

Since PL/Java 1.5.1, the supplied examples have included a not-built-by-default
[example supplying ISO SQL/XML features missing from core PostgreSQL][exsaxon].
It is not built by default because it raises the minimum Java version to 8, and
brings in the Saxon-HE XML-processing library.

In 1.5.3, the example now provides versions of the ISO SQL `XMLEXISTS`,
`XMLQUERY`, `XMLTABLE`, and `XMLCAST` functions based on the W3C XQuery
language as ISO SQL specifies (while PostgreSQL has an "XMLTABLE" function
since release 10 and "XMLEXISTS" since 9.1, they have
[numerous limitations][appD31] inherited from a library that does not support
XQuery, and additional peculiarities prior to PostgreSQL 12), and the ISO SQL
`LIKE_REGEX`, `OCCURRENCES_REGEX`, `POSITION_REGEX`, `SUBSTRING_REGEX`, and
`TRANSLATE_REGEX` functions that apply XQuery regular expressions. It also
includes the `XMLTEXT` function, which is rather trivial, but also missing from
core PostgreSQL, and supplied here for completeness.

As plain user-defined functions without special treatment in PostgreSQL's SQL
parser, these functions cannot be used with the exact syntax specified in
ISO SQL, but require simple rewriting into equivalent forms that are valid
ordinary PostgreSQL function calls. The rewritten forms are intended to be easy
to read and correspond closely to the ISO syntax.

While still presented as examples and not a full implementation, these functions
are now intended to be substantially usable (subject to minor
[documented limits][exsaxon]), and testing and reports of shortcomings are
welcome.

$h4 ResultSet holdability again

A `ResultSet` obtained from a query done in PL/Java would return the value
`CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT` to a caller of its `getHoldability` method, but in
reality would become unusable as soon as the PL/Java function creating it
returned to PostgreSQL. That was fixed in PL/Java 1.5.1 for a `ResultSet`
obtained from a `Statement`, but not for one obtained from a
`PreparedStatement`. It now correctly remains usable to the end of the
transaction in either case.

$h4 Savepoint behavior at rollback

Per JDBC, a `Savepoint` still exists after being used in a rollback, and can be
used again; the rollback only invalidates any `Savepoint` that had been created
after the one being rolled back. That should be familiar behavior, as it is the
same as PostgreSQL's own SQL `SAVEPOINT` behavior. It is also correct in pgJDBC,
which has test coverage to confirm it. PL/Java has been doing it wrong.

In 1.5.3 it now has the JDBC-specified behavior. For compatibility with existing
application code, the meaning of the `pljava.release_lingering_savepoints`
[configuration variable](use/variables.html) has been adjusted. The setting
tells PL/Java what to do if a `Savepoint` still exists, neither released nor
rolled back, at the time a function exits. If `on`, the savepoint is released
(committed); if `off`, the savepoint is rolled back. A warning is issued in
either case.

In an existing function that used savepoints and assumed that a rolled-back
savepoint would be no longer live, it will now be normal for such a savepoint
to reach the function exit still alive. To recognize this case, PL/Java tracks
whether any savepoint has been rolled back at least once. At function exit, any
savepoint that has been neither released nor ever rolled back is disposed of
according to the `release_lingering_savepoints` setting and with a warning,
as before, but any savepoint that has already been rolled back at least once
is simply released, regardless of the variable setting, and without producing
a warning.

$h4 Control of function parameter names in generated SQL

When generating the `CREATE FUNCTION` command in a deployment descriptor
according to an annotated Java function, PL/Java ordinarily gives the function
parameters names that match their Java names, unquoted. Because PostgreSQL
allows named notation when calling a function, the parameter names in its
declaration become part of its signature that cannot later be changed without
dropping and re-creating the function.

In some cases, explicit control of the SQL parameter names may be wanted,
independently of the Java names: to align with an external standard, perhaps,
or when either the SQL or the Java name would collide with a reserved word.
For that purpose, the (already slightly overloaded) `@SQLType` annotation now
has a `name` attribute that can specify the SQL name of the annotated parameter.

$h4 Documentation

The user guide and guide for packagers contained incorrect instructions for
using Maven to build a single subproject of PL/Java (such as `pljava-api` or
`pljava-examples`) instead of the full project. Those have been corrected.

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.2 (5 November 2018)

A pure bug-fix release, correcting a regression in 1.5.1 that was not caught
in pre-release testing, and could leave
[conversions between PostgreSQL `date` and `java.sql.Date`](${ghbug}199) off
by one day in certain timezones and times of the year.

1.5.1 added support for the newer `java.time` classes from JSR 310 / JDBC 4.2,
which are [recommended as superior alternatives](use/datetime.html) to the
older conversions involving `java.sql.Date` and related classes. The new
versions are superior in part because they do not have hidden timezone
dependencies.

However, the change to the historical `java.sql.Date` conversion behavior was
inadvertent, and is fixed in this release.

$h3 Open issues with date/time/timestamp conversions

During preparation of this release, other issues of longer standing were also
uncovered in the legacy conversions between PG `date`, `time`, and
`timestamp` classes and the `java.sql` types. They are detailed in
[issue #200](${ghbug}200). Because they are not regressions but long-established
behavior, they are left untouched in this release, and will be fixed in
a future release.

The Java 8 `java.time` conversions are free of these issues as well.

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.1 (17 October 2018)

This release adds support for PostgreSQL 9.6, 10, and 11,
and plays more nicely with `pg_upgrade`. If a PostgreSQL installation
is to be upgraded using `pg_upgrade`, and is running a version of
PL/Java before 1.5.1, the PL/Java version should first be upgraded
in the running PostgreSQL version, and then the PostgreSQL `pg_upgrade`
can be done.

The documentation is expanded on the topic of shared-memory precompiled
class cache features, which can substantially improve JVM startup time
and memory footprint, and are now available across Oracle Java, OpenJDK
with Hotspot, and OpenJDK with OpenJ9. When running on OpenJ9, PL/Java
cooperates with the JVM to include even the application's classes
(those loaded with `install_jar`) in the shared cache, something not
yet possible with Hotspot. While the advanced sharing feature in Oracle
Java is still subject to a commercial licensing encumbrance, the equivalent
(or superior, with OpenJ9) features in OpenJDK are not encumbered.

Significant new functionality includes new datatype mapping support:
SQL `date`, `time`, and `timestamp` values can be mapped to the new
Java classes of the `java.time` package in Java 8 and later (JSR 310 /
JDBC 4.2), which are much more faithful representations of the values
in SQL. Values of `xml` type can be manipulated efficiently using the
JDBC 4.0 `SQLXML` API, supporting several different APIs for XML
processing in Java.

For Java code that does not use the new date/time classes in the
`java.time` package, some minor conversion inaccuracies (less than
two seconds) in the older mapping to `java.sql.Timestamp` have been
corrected.

Queries from PL/Java code now produce `ResultSet`s that are usable to the
end of the containing transaction, as they had already been claiming to be.

With PostgreSQL 9.6 support comes the ability to declare functions
`PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }`, and with PG 10 support,
transition tables are available to triggers.

$h3 Security

$h4 Schema-qualification

PL/Java now more consistently schema-qualifies objects in queries and DDL
it generates internally, as a measure of defense-in-depth in case the database
it is installed in has not been [protected][prot1058] from [CVE-2018-1058][].

_No schema-qualification work has been done on the example code._ If the
examples jar will be installed, it should be in a database that
[the recommended steps have been taken to secure][prot1058].

$h4 Some large-object code removed

1.5.1 removes the code at issue in [CVE-2016-0768][], which pertained to
PostgreSQL large objects, but had never been documented or exposed as API.

This is not expected to break any existing code at all, based on further
review showing the code in question had also been simply broken, since 2006,
with no reported issues in that time. That discovery would support an argument
for downgrading the severity of the reported vulnerability, but with no need
to keep that code around, it is more satisfying to remove it entirely.

Developers wishing to manipulate large objects in PL/Java are able to do so
using the SPI JDBC interface and the large-object SQL functions already
available in every PostgreSQL version PL/Java currently supports.

$h3 Version compatibility

PL/Java 1.5.1 can be built against recent PostgreSQL versions including 11,
and older ones back to 8.2, using Java SE 8, 7, or 6. It can _run_ using newer
Java versions including Java 11. PL/Java functions can be written for, and use
features of, the Java version loaded at run time. See
[version compatibility][versions] for more detail.

OpenJDK is supported, and can be downloaded in versions using the Hotspot or the
OpenJ9 JVM. Features of modern Java VMs can drastically reduce memory footprint
and startup time, in particular class-data sharing. Several choices of Java
runtime now offer such features: Oracle Java has a simple class data sharing
feature for the JVM itself, freely usable in all supported versions, and an
"application class data sharing" feature in Java 8 and later that can also share
the internal classes of PL/Java, but is a commercial feature requiring a
license from Oracle. As of Java 10, the same application class sharing feature
is present in OpenJDK/Hotspot, where it is freely usable without an additional
license. OpenJDK/OpenJ9 includes a different, and very sophisticated, class
sharing feature, freely usable from Java 8 onward. More on these features
can be found [in the installation docs][vmopts].

$h3 Changes

$h4 Typing of parameters in prepared statements

PL/Java currently does not determine the necessary types of `PreparedStatement`
parameters from the results of PostgreSQL's own type analysis of the query
(as a network client would, when using PostgreSQL's "extended query" protocol).
PostgreSQL added the means to do so in SPI only in PostgreSQL 9.0, and a future
PL/Java major release should use it. However, this release does make two small
changes to the current behavior.

Without the query analysis results from PostgreSQL, PL/Java tries to type the
prepared-statement parameters based on the types of values supplied by the
application Java code. It now has two additional ways to do so:

* If Java code supplies a Java user-defined type (UDT)---that is, an object
    implementing the `SQLData` interface---PL/Java will now call the `SQLData`
    method `getSQLTypeName` on that object and use the result to pin down
    the PostgreSQL type of the parameter. Existing code should already provide
    this method, but could, in the past, have returned a bogus result without
    detection, as PL/Java did not use it.

* Java code can use the three-argument form of `setNull` to specify the exact
    PostgreSQL type for a parameter, and then another method can be used to
    supply a non-null value for it. If the following non-null value has
    a default mapping to a different PostgreSQL type, in most cases it will
    overwrite the type supplied with `setNull` and re-plan the query. That was
    PL/Java's existing behavior, and was not changed for this minor release.
    However, the new types introduced in this release---the `java.time` types
    and `SQLXML`---behave in the way that should become universal in a future
    major release: the already-supplied PostgreSQL type will be respected, and
    PL/Java will try to find a usable coercion to it.

$h4 Inaccuracies converting TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMPTZ

When converting between PostgreSQL values of `timestamp` or `timestamptz` type
and the pre-Java 8 original JDBC type `java.sql.Timestamp`, there were cases
where values earlier than 1 January 2000 would produce exceptions rather than
converting successfully. Those have been fixed.

Also, converting in the other direction, from `java.sql.Timestamp` to a
PostgreSQL timestamp, an error of up to 1.998 seconds (averaging 0.999)
could be introduced.

That error has been corrected. If an application has stored Java `Timestamp`s
and corresponding SQL `timestamp`s generated in the past and requires them
to match, it could be affected by this change.

$h4 New date/time/timestamp API in Java 8 `java.time` package

The old, and still default, mappings in JDBC from the SQL `date`, `time`, and
`timestamp` types to `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time`, and `java.sql.Timestamp`,
were never well suited to represent the PostgreSQL data types. The `Time` and
`Timestamp` classes were used to map both the with-timezone and without-timezone
variants of the corresponding SQL types and, clearly, could not represent both
equally well. These Java classes all contain timezone dependencies, requiring
the conversion to involve timezone calculations even when converting non-zoned
SQL types, and making the conversion results for non-zoned types implicitly
depend on the current PostgreSQL session timezone setting.

Applications are strongly encouraged to adopt Java 8 as a minimum language
version and use the new-in-Java-8 types in the `java.time` package, which
eliminate those problems and map the SQL types much more faithfully.
For PL/Java function parameters and returns, the class in the method declaration
can simply be changed. For retrieving date/time/timestamp values from a
`ResultSet` or `SQLInput` object, use the variants of `getObject` / `readObject`
that take a `Class<?>` parameter. The class to use is:

| PostgreSQL type | `java.time` class |
|--:|:--|
|`date`|`LocalDate`|
|`time without time zone`|`LocalTime`|
|`time with time zone`|`OffsetTime`|
|`timestamp without time zone`|`LocalDateTime`|
|`timestamp with time zone`|`OffsetDateTime`|
[Correspondence of PostgreSQL date/time types and Java 8 `java.time` classes]

Details on these mappings are [added to the documentation](use/datetime.html).

$h4 Newly supported `java.sql.SQLXML` type

PL/Java has not, until now, supported the JDBC 4.0 `SQLXML` type. PL/Java
functions have been able to work with PostgreSQL XML values by mapping them
as Java `String`, but that conversion could introduce character encoding issues
outside the control of the XML APIs, and also has memory implications if an
application stores, or generates in queries, large XML values. Even if the
processing to be done in the application could be structured to run in constant
bounded memory while streaming through the XML, a conversion to `String`
requires the whole, uncompressed, character-serialized value to be brought into
the Java heap at once, and any heap-size tuning has to account for that
worst-case size. The `java.sql.SQLXML` API solves those problems by allowing
XML manipulation with any of several Java XML APIs with the data remaining in
PostgreSQL native memory, never brought fully into the Java heap unless that is
what the application does. Heap sizing can be based on the just the
application's processing needs.

The `SQLXML` type can take the place of `String` in PL/Java function parameters
and returns simply by changing their declarations from `String` to `SQLXML`.
When retrieving XML values from `ResultSet` or `SQLInput` objects, the legacy
`getObject / readObject` methods will continue to return `String` for existing
application compatibility, so the specific `getSQLXML / readSQLXML` methods, or
the forms of `getObject / readObject` with a `Class<?>` parameter and passing
`SQLXML.class`, must be used. A [documentation page](use/sqlxml.html) has been
added, and the [PassXML example][exxml] illustrates use of the API.

A [not-built-by-default new example][exsaxon] (because it depends on Java 8 and
the Saxon-HE XML-processing library) provides a partial implementation of true
`XMLQUERY` and `XMLTABLE` functions for PostgreSQL, using the standard-specified
XML Query language rather than the XPath 1.0 of the native PostgreSQL functions.

[exxml]: pljava-examples/apidocs/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/PassXML.html
[exsaxon]: examples/saxon.html

$h4 New Java property exposes the PostgreSQL server character-set encoding

A Java system property, `org.postgresql.server.encoding`, is set to the
canonical name of a supported Java `Charset` that corresponds to PostgreSQL's
`server_encoding` setting, if one can be found. If the server encoding's name
is not recognized as any known Java `Charset`, this property will be unset, and
some functionality, such as the `SQLXML` API, may be limited. If a Java
`Charset` does exist (or is made available through a `CharsetProvider`) that
does match the PostgreSQL server encoding, but is not automatically selected
because of a naming mismatch, the `org.postgresql.server.encoding` property can
be set (with a `-D` in `pljava.vmoptions`) to select it by name.

$h4 ResultSet holdability

A `ResultSet` obtained from a query done in PL/Java would return the value
`CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT` to a caller of its `getHoldability` method, but in
reality would become unusable as soon as the PL/Java function creating it
returned to PostgreSQL. It now remains usable to the end of the transaction,
as claimed.

$h4 PostgreSQL 9.6 and parallel query

A function in PL/Java can now be [annotated][apianno]
`parallel={UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE}`, with `UNSAFE` the default.
A new [user guide section][ugparqry] explains the possibilities and
tradeoffs. (Good cases for marking a PL/Java function `SAFE` may be
rare, as pushing such a function into multiple background processes
will require them all to start JVMs. But if a practical application
arises, PostgreSQL's `parallel_setup_cost` can be tuned to help the
planner make good plans.)

Although `RESTRICTED` and `SAFE` Java functions work in simple tests,
there has been no exhaustive audit of the code to ensure that PL/Java's
internal workings never violate the behavior constraints on such functions.
The support should be considered experimental, and could be a fruitful
area for beta testing.

[ugparqry]: use/parallel.html

$h4 Tuple counts widened to 64 bits with PostgreSQL 9.6

To accommodate the possibility of more than two billion tuples in a single
operation, the SPI implementation of the JDBC `Statement` interface now
provides the JDK 8-specified `executeLargeBatch` and `getLargeUpdateCount`
methods defined to return `long` counts. The original `executeBatch` and
`getUpdateCount` methods remain but, obviously, cannot return counts that
exceed `INT_MAX`. In case the count is too large, `getUpdateCount` will throw
an `ArithmeticException`; `executeBatch` will store `SUCCESS_NO_INFO` for
any statement in the batch that affected too many tuples to report.

For now, a `ResultSetProvider` cannot be used to return more than `INT_MAX`
tuples, but will check that condition and throw an error to ensure predictable
behavior.

$h4 `pg_upgrade`

PL/Java should be upgraded to 1.5.1 in a database cluster, before that
cluster is binary-upgraded to a newer PostgreSQL version using `pg_upgrade`.
A new [Upgrading][upgrading] installation-guide section centralizes information
on both upgrading PL/Java in a database, and upgrading a database with PL/Java
in it.

[upgrading]: install/upgrade.html

$h4 Suppressing row operations from triggers

In PostgreSQL, a `BEFORE ROW` trigger is able to allow the proposed row
operation, allow it with modified values, or silently suppress the operation
for that row. Way back in PL/Java 1.1.0, the way to produce the 'suppress'
outcome was for the trigger method to throw an exception. Since PL/Java 1.2.0,
however, an exception thrown in a trigger method is used to signal an error
to PostgreSQL, and there has not been a way to suppress the row operation.

The `TriggerData` interface now has a [`suppress`][tgsuppress] method that
the trigger can invoke to suppress the operation for the row.

[tgsuppress]: pljava-api/apidocs/org.postgresql.pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/TriggerData.html#suppress()

$h4 Constraint triggers

New attributes in the `@Trigger` annotation allow the SQL generator to
create constraint triggers (a type of trigger that can be created with SQL
since PostgreSQL 9.1). Such triggers will be delivered by the PL/Java runtime
(to indicate that a constraint would be violated, a constraint trigger
method should throw an informative exception). However, the trigger method
will have access, through the `TriggerData` interface, only to the properties
common to ordinary triggers; methods on that interface to retrieve properties
specific to constraint triggers have not been added for this release.

$h4 PostgreSQL 10 and trigger transition tables

A trigger [annotation][apianno] can now specify `tableOld="`_name1_`"` or
`tableNew="`_name2_`"`, or both, and the PL/Java function servicing the
trigger can do SPI JDBC queries and see the transition table(s) under the
given name(s). The [triggers example code][extrig] has been extended with
a demonstration.

[extrig]: $project.scm.url/pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/Triggers.java

$h4 Logging from Java

The way the Java logging system has historically been plumbed to PostgreSQL's,
as described in [issue 125](${ghbug}125), can be perplexing both because it
is unaffected by later changes to the PostgreSQL settings after PL/Java is
loaded in the session, and because it has honored only `log_min_messages`
and ignored `client_min_messages`. The second part is easy to fix, so in
1.5.1 the threshold where Java discards messages on the fast path is
determined by the finer of `log_min_messages` and `client_min_messages`.

$h4 Conveniences for downstream package maintainers

The `mvn` command to build PL/Java will now accept an option to provide
a useful default for `pljava.libjvm_location`, when building a package for
a particular software environment where the likely path to Java is known.

The `mvn` command will also accept an option to specify, by the path to
the `pg_config` executable, the PostgreSQL version to build against, in
case multiple versions exist on the build host. This was already possible
by manipulating `PATH` ahead of running `mvn`, but the option makes it more
explicit.

A new [packaging section][packaging] in the build guide documents those
and a number of considerations for making a PL/Java package.

$h2 PL/Java 1.5.0 (29 March 2016)

This, the first PL/Java numbered release since 1.4.3 in 2011, combines
compatibility with the latest PostgreSQL and Java versions with modernized
build and installation procedures, automatic generation of SQL deployment
code from Java annotations, and many significant fixes.

$h3 Security

Several security issues are addressed in this release. Sites already
using PL/Java are encouraged to update to 1.5.0. For several of the
issues below, practical measures are described to mitigate risk until
an update can be completed.

[CVE-2016-0766][], a privilege escalation requiring an authenticated
PostgreSQL connection, is closed by installing PL/Java 1.5.0 (including
prereleases) or by updating PostgreSQL itself to at least 9.5.1, 9.4.6,
9.3.11, 9.2.15, 9.1.20. Vulnerable systems are only those running both
an older PL/Java and an older PostgreSQL.

[CVE-2016-0767][], in which an authenticated PostgreSQL user with USAGE
permission on the `public` schema may alter the `public` schema classpath,
is closed by release 1.5.0 (including prereleases). If updating to 1.5.0
must be delayed, risk can be mitigated by revoking public `EXECUTE` permission
on `sqlj.set_classpath` and granting it selectively to responsible users or
roles.

This release brings a policy change to a more secure-by-default posture,
where the ability to create functions in `LANGUAGE java` is no longer
automatically granted to `public`, but can be selectively granted to roles
that will have that responsibility. The change reduces exposure to a known
issue present in 1.5.0 and earlier versions, that will be closed in a future
release ([CVE-2016-0768][], see **large objects, access control** below).

The new policy will be applied in a new installation; permissions will not
be changed in an upgrade, but any site can move to this policy, even before
updating to 1.5.0, with `REVOKE USAGE ON LANGUAGE java FROM public;` followed by
explicit `GRANT` commands for the users/roles expected to create Java
functions.

[CVE-2016-2192][], in which an authenticated user can alter type mappings
without owning the types involved. Exploitability is limited by other
permissions, but if type mapping is a feature being used at a site, one
can interfere with proper operation of code that relies on it. A mitigation
is simply to `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC` on the `sqlj.add_type_mapping`
and `sqlj.drop_type_mapping` functions, and grant the privilege only to
selected users or roles. As of 1.5.0, these functions require the invoker
to be superuser or own the type being mapped.

$h3 Version compatibility

PL/Java 1.5.0 can be built against recent PostgreSQL versions including 9.5,
using Java SE 8, 7, or 6. See [version compatibility][versions] for more
detail. OpenJDK is well supported. Support for GCJ has been dropped; features
of modern Java VMs that are useful to minimize footprint and startup time,
such as class-data sharing, are now more deeply covered
[in the installation docs][vmopts].

[versions]: build/versions.html
[vmopts]: install/vmoptions.html

$h3 Build procedures

Since 2013, PL/Java has been hosted [on GitHub][ghpljava] and built
using [Apache Maven][mvn]. See the new [build instructions][bld] for details.

Reported build issues for specific platforms have been resolved,
with new platform-specific build documentation
for [OS X][osxbld], [Solaris][solbld], [Ubuntu][ububld],
[Windows MSVC][msvcbld], and [Windows MinGW-w64][mgwbld].

The build produces a redistributable installation archive usable with
the version of PostgreSQL built against and the same operating system,
architecture, and linker. The type of archive is `jar` on all platforms, as
all PL/Java installations will have Java available.

[ghpljava]: https://github.com/tada/pljava
[mvn]: http://maven.apache.org/
[bld]: build/build.html
[msvcbld]: build/buildmsvc.html
[mgwbld]: build/mingw64.html
[osxbld]: build/macosx.html
[solbld]: build/solaris.html
[ububld]: build/ubuntu.html

$h3 Installation procedures

The jar produced by the build is executable and will self-extract,
consulting `pg_config` on the destination system to find the correct
default locations for the extracted files. Any location can be overridden.
(Enhancement requests [6][gh6], [9][gh9])

PL/Java now uses a PostgreSQL configuration variable, `pljava.libjvm_location`,
to find the Java runtime to use, eliminating the past need for highly
platform-specific tricks like link-time options or runtime-loader configuration
just so that PL/Java could find Java. PostgreSQL configuration variables are
now the only form of configuration needed for PL/Java, and the `libjvm_location`
should be the only setting needed if file locations have not been overridden.

In PostgreSQL 9.1 and later, PL/Java can be installed with
`CREATE EXTENSION pljava`. Regardless of PostgreSQL version, installation
has been simplified. Former procedures involving `Deployer` or `install.sql`
are no longer required. Details are in the [new installation instructions][ins].

$h4 Schema migration

The tables used internally by PL/Java have changed. If PL/Java 1.5.0 is
loaded in a database with an existing `sqlj` schema populated by an earlier
PL/Java version (1.3.0 or later), the structure will be updated without data
loss (enhancement request [12][gh12]). *Remember that PL/Java runs independently
in each database session where it is in use. Older PL/Java versions active in
other sessions can be disrupted by the schema change.*

A trial installation of PL/Java 1.5.0 can be done in a transaction, and
rolled back if desired, leaving the schema as it was. Any concurrent sessions
with active older PL/Java versions will not be disrupted by the altered schema
as long as the transaction remains open, *but they may block for the duration,
so such a test transaction should be kept short*.

[ins]: install/install.html

$h3 Changes

$h4 Behavior of `readSQL` and `writeSQL` for base and mirror user-defined types

In the course of fixing [issue #98][gh98], the actual behavior of
`readSQL` and `writeSQL` with base or mirror types, which had not
previously been documented, [now is](develop/coercion.html), along with
other details of PL/Java's type coercion rules found only in the code.
Because machine byte order was responsible for issue #98, it now (a) is
selectable, and (b) has different, appropriate, defaults for mirror UDTs
(which need to match PostgreSQL's order) and for base UDTs (which must
stay big-endian because of how binary `COPY` is specified).
A [new documentation section](use/byteorder.html) explains in detail.

$h4 `USAGE` to `PUBLIC` no longer default for `java` language

Of the two languages installed by PL/Java, functions that declare
`LANGUAGE javau` can be created only by superusers, while those that
declare `LANGUAGE java` can be created by any user or role granted the
`USAGE` privilege on the language.

In the past, the language `java` has been created with PostgreSQL's
default permission granting `USAGE` to `PUBLIC`, but PL/Java 1.5.0
leaves the permission to be explicitly granted to those users or roles
expected to create Java functions, in keeping with least-privilege
principles. See **large objects, access control** under **known issues**
for background.

$h4 SQL generated by Java annotations

Java code developed for use by PL/Java can carry in-code annotations,
used by the Java compiler to generate the SQL commands to declare the
new functions, types, triggers, etc. in PostgreSQL (enhancement request
[1011112][], though different in implementation). This eliminates the need
to have Java code and the corresponding SQL commands developed in parallel,
and the class of errors possible when both are not updated together. It
also allows compile-time checks that the Java methods or classes being
annotated are suitable (correct access modifiers, signatures, etc.)
for their declared SQL purposes, rather than discovering
such issues only upon loading the code into PostgreSQL and trying to use it.

The Java compiler writes the generated SQL into a "deployment descriptor"
file (`pljava.ddr` by default), as specified by the SQL/JRT standard. The
file can be included in a `jar` archive with the compiled code, and the
commands will be executed by PL/Java when the `install_jar` function is
used to load the jar.

SQL generation is covered in the [updated user documentation][user],
and illustrated in the [Hello, World example][hello] and
[several other supplied examples][exanno]. Reference information
is [in the API documentation][apianno]. It is currently usable to declare
functions, triggers, and user-defined types, both base and composite.

[user]: use/use.html
[hello]: use/hello.html
[exanno]: $project.scm.url/pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation
[apianno]: pljava-api/apidocs/org.postgresql.pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/annotation/package-summary.html#package-description

The history of this feature in PL/Java is long, with the first related commits
appearing in 2005, six years in advance of an enhancement request for it.
It became generally usable in 2013 when building with
Java SE 6 or later, using the annotation processing framework Java introduced
in that release. 1.5.0 is the first PL/Java numbered release to feature it.

$h5 Annotation keyword changes

If you have been using the SQL generation feature in prerelease `git` builds of
2013 or later, be aware that some annotation keywords have changed in finalizing
the 1.5.0 release. Java code that was compiled using the earlier keywords will
continue to work, but will have to be updated before it can be recompiled.

* For functions: `effects=(VOLATILE,STABLE,IMMUTABLE)` was formerly `type=`
* For functions: `type=` (_an explicit SQL return type for the function_)
    was formerly `complexType=`
* For functions: `trust=(SANDBOXED,UNSANDBOXED)` was formerly
    `(RESTRICTED,UNRESTRICTED)`
* For triggers: `called=(BEFORE,AFTER,INSTEAD_OF)` was formerly `when=`
    and conflicted with the `WHEN` clause introduced for triggers
    in PostgreSQL 9.0.

$h4 A jar may have more than one deployment descriptor

PL/Java formerly allowed only one entry in a jar to be a deployment
descriptor (that is, a file of SQL commands to be executed upon loading
or unloading the jar). The SQL/JRT standard allows multiple entries to
be deployment descriptors, executed in the order they are mentioned
_in the jar manifest_, or the reverse of that order when the jar is
being unloaded. PL/Java now conforms to the standard.

The behavior is useful during transition to annotation-driven deployment
descriptor generation for a project that already has a manually-maintained
deployment descriptor. PL/Java's own `pljava-examples` project is an
illustration, in the midst of such a transition itself.

Note the significance placed by SQL/JRT on the order of entries in a jar
manifest, whose order is normally _not_ significant according to the Jar File
Specification. Care can be needed when manipulating manifests with automated
tools that may not preserve order.

$h4 Conditional execution within deployment descriptors

Deployment descriptors have a primitive conditional-execution provision
defined in the SQL/JRT standard: commands wrapped in a  
`BEGIN IMPLEMENTOR ` _identifier_ construct will only be executed if the
_identifier_ is recognized by the SQL/JRT implementation in use. The design
makes possible jars that can be installed on different database systems that
provide SQL/JRT features, with database-specific commands wrapped in
`BEGIN IMPLEMENTOR` blocks with an _identifier_ specific to the system.
By default, PL/Java recognizes the _identifier_ `postgresql` (matched without
regard to case).

PL/Java extends the standard by allowing the PostgreSQL configuration
variable `pljava.implementors` to contain a list of identifiers that will
be recognized. SQL code in a deployment descriptor can conditionally add
or remove identifiers in this list to influence which subsequent implementor
blocks will be executed, giving a still-primitive but more general control
structure.

In sufficiently recent PostgreSQL versions, the same effect could be
achieved using `DO` statements and PL/pgSQL control structures, but this
facility in PL/Java does not require either to be available.

$h4 Interaction with `SET ROLE` corrected

PL/Java formerly was aware of the user ID associated with the running
session, but not any role ID that user may have acquired with `SET ROLE`.
The result would commonly be failed permission checks made by PL/Java when
the session user did not have the needed permission, but had `SET ROLE` to
a role that did. Likewise, within `install_jar`, PL/Java would execute
deployment descriptor commands as the original session user rather than
as the user's current role, with permission failures a likely result.

Correcting this issue has changed the PL/Java API, but without a bump
of major version because the prior API, while deprecated, is still available.

* [`getOuterUserName`][goun] and [`executeAsOuterUser`][eaou] are new, and
    correctly refer to the session user or current role, when active.
* [`getSessionUserName`][gsun] and [`executeAsSessionUser`][easu] are still
    present but deprecated, and _their semantics are changed_. They are now
    deprecated aliases for the corresponding new methods, which honor the
    set role. Use cases that genuinely need to refer only to the _session_ user
    and ignore the role should be rare, and should be discussed on the mailing
    list or opened as issues.

#set($sessapi = 'pljava-api/apidocs/org.postgresql.pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/Session.html#')

[goun]: ${sessapi}getOuterUserName()
[eaou]: ${sessapi}executeAsOuterUser(java.sql.Connection,java.lang.String)
[gsun]: ${sessapi}getSessionUserName()
[easu]: ${sessapi}executeAsSessionUser(java.sql.Connection,java.lang.String)

$h4 Unicode transparency

Since the resolution of [bug 21][gh21], PL/Java contains a regression test
to ensure that character strings passed and returned between PostgreSQL and
Java will round-trip without alteration for the full range of Unicode
characters, _when the database encoding is set to `UTF8`_.

More considerations apply when the database encoding is anything other
than `UTF8`, and especially when it is `SQL_ASCII`. Please see
[character encoding support][charsets] for more.

$h3 Updated PostgreSQL APIs tracked

Several APIs within PostgreSQL itself have been added or changed;
PL/Java now uses the current versions of these where appropriate:

* `find_coercion_pathway`
* `set_stack_base`
* `GetOuterUserId`
* `GetUserNameFromId`
* `GetUserIdAndSecContext`
* `pg_attribute_*`
* Large objects: truncate, and 64-bit offsets

$h3 Known issues and areas for future work

$h4 Developments in PostgreSQL not yet covered

Large objects, access control
: PL/Java does not yet expose PostgreSQL large objects with a documented,
    stable API, and the support it does contain was developed against pre-9.0
    PostgreSQL versions, where no access control applied to large objects and
    any object could be accessed by any database user. PL/Java's behavior is
    proper for PostgreSQL before 9.0, but improper on 9.0+ where it would be
    expected to honor access controls on large objects ([CVE-2016-0768][]).
    This will be corrected in a future release. For this and earlier releases,
    the recommendation is to selectively grant `USAGE` on the `java` language to
    specific users or roles responsible for creating Java functions; see
    "default `USAGE` permssion" under Changes.

`INSTEAD OF` triggers, triggers on `TRUNCATE`
: These are supported by annotations and the SQL generator, and the runtime
    will deliver them to the specified method, but the `TriggerData` interface
    has no new methods to recognize these cases (that is, no added
    methods analogous to `isFiredAfter`, `isFiredByDelete`). For a method
    expressly coded to be a `TRUNCATE` trigger or an `INSTEAD OF` trigger,
    that is not a problem, but care should be taken when coding a trigger
    method to handle more than one type of trigger, or creating triggers of
    these new types that call a method developed pre-PL/Java-1.5.0. Such a
    method could be called with a `TriggerData` argument whose existing
    `isFired...` methods all return `false`, likely to put the method on an
    unexpected code path.

    A later PL/Java version should introduce trigger interfaces that better
    support such evolution of PostgreSQL in a type-safe way.

Constraint triggers
: Constraint trigger syntax is not supported by annotations and the SQL
    generator. If declared (using hand-written SQL), they will be delivered
    by the runtime, but without any constraint-trigger-specific information
    available to the called method.

Event triggers
: Event triggers are not yet supported by annotations or the SQL generator,
    and will not be delivered by the PL/Java runtime.

Range types
: No predefined mappings for range types are provided.

`PRE_PREPARE`, `PRE_COMMIT`, `PARALLEL_ABORT`, `PARALLEL_PRE_COMMIT`, and `PARALLEL_COMMIT` transaction callbacks, `PRE_COMMIT` subtransaction callbacks
: Listeners for these events cannot be registered and the events will not
    be delivered.

$h4 Imperfect integration with PostgreSQL dependency tracking

In a dump/restore, manual intervention can be needed if the users/roles
recorded as owners of jars are missing or have been renamed. A current
[thread on `pgsql-hackers`][ownhack] should yield a better solution for
a future release.

[ownhack]: http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/56783412.6090005@anastigmatix.net

$h4 Quirk if deployment descriptor loads classes from same jar

The `install_jar` function installs a jar, optionally reading deployment
descriptors from the jar and executing the install actions they contain.
It is possible for those actions to load classes from the jar just installed.
(This would be unlikely if the install actions are limited to typical setup,
function/operator/datatype creation, but likely, if the install actions also
include basic function tests, or if the setup requirements are more
interesting.)

If, for any class in the jar, the first attempt to load that class is made
while resolving a function declared `STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE`, a
`ClassNotFoundException` results. The cause is PostgreSQL's normal treatment of
a `STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE` function, which relies on a snapshot from the start of
the `install_jar` query, when the jar was not yet installed. A workaround is to
ensure that the install actions cause each needed class to be loaded, such as
by calling a `VOLATILE` function it supplies, before calling one that is
`STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE`. (One could even write install actions to declare a
needed function `VOLATILE` before the first call and then redeclare it.)

This issue should be resolved as part of a broader rework of class loading
in a future PL/Java release.

$h4 Partial implementation of JDBC 4 and later

The changes to make PL/Java build under Java SE 6 and later, with version 4.0
and later of JDBC, involved providing the specified methods so
compilation would succeed, with real implementations for some, but for others
only stub versions that throw `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` if used.
Regrettably, there is nothing in the documentation indicating which methods
have real implementations and which do not; to create such a list would require
an audit of that code. If a method throws the exception when you call it, it's
one of the unimplemented ones.

Individual methods may be fleshed out with implementations as use cases arise
that demand them, but for a long-term roadmap, it seems more promising to
reduce the overhead of maintaining another JDBC implementation by sharing
code with `pgjdbc`, as has been [discussed on pljava-dev][jdbcinherit].

[jdbcinherit]: http://lists.pgfoundry.org/pipermail/pljava-dev/2015/002370.html

$h4 Exception handling and logging

PL/Java does interconvert between PostgreSQL and Java exceptions, but with
some loss of fidelity in the two directions. PL/Java code has some access
to most fields of a PostgreSQL error data structure, but only through
internal PL/Java API that is not expected to remain usable, and code written
for PL/Java has never quite had first-class standing in its ability to
_generate_ exceptions as information-rich as those from PostgreSQL itself.

PL/Java in some cases generates the _categorized `SQLException`s_ introduced
with JDBC 4.0, and in other cases does not.

This area may see considerable change in a future release.
[Thoughts on logging][tol] is a preview of some of the considerations.

[tol]: https://github.com/tada/pljava/wiki/Thoughts-on-logging

$h4 Types with type modifiers and `COPY`

Although it is possible to create a PL/Java user-defined type that accepts
a type modifier (see the [example][typmex]), such a type will not yet be
handled by SQL `COPY` or any other operation that requires the `input` or
`receive` function to handle the modifier. This is left for a future release.

Other commits:

For a multi-threaded pljava function we need to adjust stack_base_ptr
before calling into the backend to avoid stack depth limit exceeded
errors.  Previously this was done only on query execution, but we need
to do it on iteration of the ResultSet as well.

When creating a variable length data type, the code was directly
assigning the varlena header length rather than going through an
access macro.  The header format changed for the 8.3 release and this
manual coding was not noticed and changed accordingly.  Use
SET_VARSIZE to do this correctly.

Handle passed by value data types by reading and writing directly to
the Datum rather than dereferencing it.

If the call to a type output function is the first pljava call in a
session, we get a crash.  The first pljava call results in a SPI
connection being established and torn down.  The type output function
was allocating the result in the SPI memory context which gets
destroyed prior to returning the data to the caller.  Allocate the
result in the correct context to survive function exit.

Clean up a warning about byteasend and bytearecv not having a
prototype when building against 9.0 as those declarations are now in a
new header file.


$h3 PL/Java 1.4.0 (1 February 2008)

Warning! The recent postgresql security releases changed the API of a function
that PL/Java uses. The source can be built against either version, but the
binaries will only run against the version they were built against. The PL/Java
binaries for 1.4.0 have all been built against the latest server releases (which
you should be using anyway). If you are using an older you will have to build
from source. The binary releases support: 8.3 - All versions. 8.2 - 8.2.6 and
up. 8.1 - 8.1.11 and up. 8.0 - 8.0.15 and up.

$h3 PL/Java 1.3.0 (18 June 2006)

This release is about type mapping and the creation of new types in PL/Java. An
extensive effort has gone into making the PL/Java type system extremely
flexible. Not only can you map arbitrary SQL data types to java classes. You can
also create new scalar types completely in Java. Read about the Changes in
version 1.3.

$h4 Changes

* A much improved type mapping system that will allow you to:

    * [Map any SQL type to a Java class][maptype]
    * [Create a Scalar UDT in Java][scalarudt]
    * [Map array and pseudo types][deftypemap]

$h3 PL/Java 1.2.0 (20 Nov 2005)

The PL/Java 1.2.0 release is primarily targeted at the new PostgreSQL 8.1 but
full support for 8.0.x is maintained. New features include support IN/OUT
parameters, improved meta-data handling, and better memory management.

$h3 PL/Java 1.1.0 (14 Apr 2005)

PL/Java 1.1.0 includes a lot of new features such as `DatabaseMetaData`,
`ResultSetMetaData`, language handlers for both trusted and untrusted language,
additional semantics for functions returning `SETOF`, and simple ObjectPooling.

$h3 PL/Java 1.0.1 (07 Feb 2005)

This release resolves a couple of important security issues. The most important
one is perhaps that PL/Java now is a trusted language. See [Security][] for more
info. Filip Hrbek, now member of the PL/Java project, contributed what was
needed to make this happen.

[Security]: https://github.com/tada/pljava/wiki/Security

$h3 PL/Java 1.0.0 (23 Jan 2005)

Today, after a long period of fine tuning, PL/Java 1.0.0 was finally released.
