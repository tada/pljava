<h1>Installing PL/Java</h1><section>
<h2><a name="Selecting_a_current_Java_version_to_use_with_PL.2FJava"></a>Selecting a current Java version to use with PL/Java</h2>
<p>Whichever JDK version you use to build PL/Java, you may want to
use PL/Java with another Java version at run time, so your PL/Java application
code can use the newer Java features. When you reach the step
<a href="#PLJava_configuration_variables">setting PL/Java configuration variables</a>,
the <code>pljava.libjvm_location</code> variable will allow you to do that.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="For_the_impatient"></a>For the impatient</h2>
<p>After completing the <a href="../build/build.html">build</a>:</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>java -jar pljava-packaging/target/pljava-pgX.jar

   (run the above with sufficient privilege to write in the PostgreSQL
    installation directories, or read further for how to install in
    non-standard places)

psql
CREATE EXTENSION pljava;
GRANT USAGE ON LANGUAGE java TO ...; -- see &quot;Usage permission&quot; below
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <i>pgX</i> represents the PostgreSQL version, and
&#x2026; wait, you're impatient, just look in the directory, you'll
see the jar file there.</p>
<p><i>Upgrading an older PL/Java installation? Use
<code>CREATE EXTENSION pljava FROM unpackaged;</code> after reading
<b>Upgrade installations</b>
below</i>.</p>
<p><i>Avoiding <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> for some reason? Use
<code>LOAD 'libpljava-so-1.6.8';</code> instead of the <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
command. Using a Mac? Be sure to add <code>.bundle</code> at the end of the file name
in the <code>LOAD</code> command. Windows? Remove <code>lib</code> from the front. Something else?
Keep reading.</i></p>
<p>You may get a message that some configuration variable must be set.
If so, keep reading.</p><section>
<h3><a name="What_the_above_will_do"></a>What the above will do</h3>
<p>The jar file produced in <code>pljava-packaging/target</code> at the end of the build
contains all the files needed to install PL/Java, and it is self-extracting
when simply run with <code>java -jar</code>. It does not contain any complicated,
black-box installer, and if you prefer, it is just as easy to extract
normally with the <code>jar</code> command or any <code>zip</code> tool, in which case you will
see that it contains files at symbolic paths such as</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>pljava/pkglibdir/...
pljava/sharedir/...
</code></pre></div>
<p>which you can move to wherever you like. Those names are based on
the options you would pass to <code>pg_config</code> to find
the right locations for your PostgreSQL setup, and that is exactly
what the self-extractor does. Assuming it is run with the permissions needed
to write there, it will put the PL/Java files into the expected locations,
so that <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> will find it without much configuration needed.</p>
<p>Because that is done by the extractor, you can take the built jar file to
other PostgreSQL installations, even with other filesystem layouts, and
it will put the files in the right places there too.</p>
<p>It has to be able to find <code>pg_config</code>, and if you have more than one
installation of PostgreSQL on the machine, it has to find the <i>right</i>
<code>pg_config</code>. You can either arrange the path in your environment so
the right <code>pg_config</code> comes first, or specify it with <code>-Dpgconfig=</code> on
the command line:</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>java -Dpgconfig=/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config -jar pljava-packaging/...
</code></pre></div>
<p>All of the standard install locations can also be changed with <code>-D</code>
options:</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>java -Dpgconfig.sharedir=/local/foo -jar pljava-packaging/...
</code></pre></div>
<p>would cause all the files that would normally go in the configured
share directory to be placed in <code>/local/foo</code> instead. You can therefore
install PL/Java in many situations where you might not have write access
to the standard locations, or might have other reasons to prefer
giving the files another location.</p>
<p>If you change locations, you will probably have to adjust some of PL/Java's
configuration variables to match, before installation will succeed. For that,
you will have to become patient, and read the rest of this page.</p>
<p><b>You will most probably have to set <code>pljava.libjvm_location</code>.</b> See the
next section.</p>
<p><b>It is useful to consider <code>pljava.vmoptions</code>.</b> See the
<a href="vmoptions.html">VM options page</a>.</p>
<p><i>One last small thing the extractor does, that won't automatically happen if
you extract with other tools, is make sure the text files have the right
line-ending style for your system. Everything will still work, and there
are easy fixes if you open them in an editor and they look funny. As long
as you just extract with <code>java -jar</code> the self-extractor takes care of it
for you.</i></p></section></section><section>
<h2><a name="PL.2FJava_configuration_variables"></a>PL/Java configuration variables</h2>
<p>PL/Java has configuration variables for most important file locations.
One that you will <i>almost always have to set</i> is <code>pljava.libjvm_location</code>
because the PL/Java installer doesn't control where different platforms
and packagers put the Java files. <i>(If it did, things would be a lot
more organized, have no doubt.)</i></p>
<p>You can set these variables within a database session, before issuing
the <code>LOAD</code> or <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> command. (In case you don't always get
things right on the first try, you might set them after, too.) For example:</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>SET pljava.libjvm_location TO '/usr/lib/jvm/java-9/lib/...';
</code></pre></div>
<dl>

<dt><code>pljava.libjvm_location</code></dt>
<dd>You are looking for a file named <code>libjvm</code> (or just <code>jvm</code> on some platforms,
such as Windows) with extension <code>.so</code>, <code>.dll</code>, <code>.bundle</code>,
or <code>.dylib</code> typically, buried a few directories/folders down in the
location where Java is installed. If more than one Java version is
installed, be sure to find the library from the version you want
PL/Java to use. See <a href="locatejvm.html">locating libjvm</a> for help finding it.
Then set this variable to the full pathname, including the filename
and extension.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.vmoptions</code></dt>
<dd>While it should not be necessary to set these before seeing the first signs
of life from PL/Java, there are useful options to consider setting here
before calling the installation complete. Some are described on the
<a href="vmoptions.html">VM options page</a>.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.module_path</code></dt>
<dd>There is probably no need to set this variable unless installation locations
were changed, in which case, it should be set to the final installed full
pathnames of the files that are called
<code>pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava-1.6.8.jar</code> and
<code>pljava/sharedir/pljava/pljava-api-1.6.8.jar</code> in the installer
jar. The pathnames should be separated by the appropriate character for your
platform; often a colon, or a semicolon on Windows.
Note: this variable isn't meant to point to the code you develop and
use in PL/Java&#x2014;that's what the <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/tada/pljava/wiki/SQL-functions"><code>sqlj.install_jar function</code></a>
is for.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Those three are not the only PL/Java configuration variables there are,
but it is unlikely you would have to change any others before installation
succeeds. For the rest, there is a <a href="../use/variables.html">configuration variable reference</a>
page.</p>
<p>One thing you can do with the configuration settings is quickly test that
you have built a working PL/Java before installing the files in any permanent
location. As long as the database server has access to the files in the
build tree, you can start a session and set the variables to point to them,
for a quick simple test. See <a href="locate.html">locating the built files</a> for
how to find their exact names in your build tree. After testing, you would
probably put the files in more permanent locations and discard the temporary
variable settings.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Making_the_configuration_settings_persistent"></a>Making the configuration settings persistent</h2>
<p>If you have loaded PL/Java successfully after making necessary changes to
some <code>pljava.*</code> variables, and the files are in the final locations where
you want them, you will want your variable settings to stick. The simplest
way is to reissue the same <code>SET</code> commands as
<code>ALTER DATABASE</code> <i>databasename</i> <code>SET</code> <i>variablename</i> <code>FROM CURRENT</code>
commands, which will preserve the current settings and make them effective
when any user connects to the same database.</p>
<p>Another approach is to save them to the server's configuration file.
If you wish PL/Java to be available for all databases in a cluster, it may
be more convenient to put the settings in the file than to issue
<code>ALTER DATABASE</code> for several databases, but <code>pg_ctl reload</code> will be needed
to make changed settings effective.
<code>ALTER SYSTEM</code> may be used as an alternative to editing the file.</p>
<p>If you have several databases in the cluster and you favor the
<code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> way of installing PL/Java, setting the variables
with <code>ALTER SYSTEM</code> or the cluster-wide configuration file will make
sure that <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> just works, in any database where PL/Java
is wanted. Different per-database settings can still be made if one
database needs them.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Upgrade_installations"></a>Upgrade installations</h2>
<p>PL/Java performs an upgrade installation if there is already an <code>sqlj</code> schema
with tables that match a known PL/Java schema from version 1.3.0 or later. It
will convert, preserving data, to the current schema if necessary.</p>
<p>A database cluster using PL/Java can be binary-upgraded using <code>pg_upgrade</code>
when certain requirements are met.</p>
<p>For more on both procedures, see <a href="upgrade.html">Upgrading</a>.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Usage_permission"></a>Usage permission</h2>
<p>Installation of PL/Java creates two &#x201c;languages&#x201d;, <code>java</code> and <code>javau</code>.
Functions that specify <code>LANGUAGE javau</code> can be created only by superusers,
and PL/Java's default policy grants them some filesystem access. Functions that
specify
<code>LANGUAGE java</code> can be created by any user or role that has been granted
<code>USAGE</code> permission <code>ON LANGUAGE java</code>. The default policy grants them no extra
permissions. The exact permissions granted in either case can be customized
in <a href="../use/policy.html"><code>pljava.policy</code></a>.</p>
<p><b>Note: For implications when running on Java 17 or later,
please see <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/tada/pljava/wiki/JEP-411">JEP 411</a></b>.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL, by default, would grant <code>USAGE</code> to <code>PUBLIC</code> on the <code>java</code> language,
but PL/Java takes a more conservative approach on a new installation.
In keeping with the principle of least privilege,
selective access can then be granted to those users or roles that will be
expected to install Java functions. Usage may be explicitly granted to <code>PUBLIC</code>
if a site prefers that traditional policy.</p>
<p>In a repeat or upgrade installation (the language <code>java</code> already exists),
no change will be made to the access permissions granted on it.</p></section><section>

<h2><a name="Troubleshooting_the_installation"></a>Troubleshooting the installation</h2><section>
<h3><a name="Puzzling_error_message_from_CREATE_EXTENSION"></a>Puzzling error message from <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code></h3>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>ERROR:  relation &quot;see doc: do CREATE EXTENSION PLJAVA in new session&quot;
already exists
</code></pre></div>
<p>For PL/Java, <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> is a wrapper around installation via <code>LOAD</code>
(which was needed for PostgreSQL versions now of only historical interest,
and remains supported for cases where <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> is too inflexible).
A quirk of this arrangement is that PostgreSQL treats <code>LOAD</code> as a
no-op for the remainder of a session once the library has been loaded, so
<code>CREATE EXTENSION pljava</code> works in a <i>fresh</i> session, but not in one where
PL/Java's native code is already in place.</p>
<p>In that case, you see the above message about a strangely but meaningfully
named table. The solution is simple: just retry in a new session
(in <code>psql</code>, <code>\c</code> makes that easy).</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Undefined_symbol_errors_at_LOAD_or_CREATE_EXTENSION_time"></a>Undefined symbol errors at <code>LOAD</code> or <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> time</h3>
<p>If PL/Java loading fails with undefined-symbol errors that seem to refer to
common system libraries (<code>libldap</code>, for example), see
<a href="../build/runpath.html">Building PL/Java with a <code>RUNPATH</code></a>.</p></section></section><section>
<h2><a name="More_background_and_special_considerations"></a>More background and special considerations</h2>
<p>These last sections cover a little more of what happens under the hood.
<code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> wraps these details up nicely, but they may still be
of interest for particular needs.</p><section>
<h3><a name="Install.2C_configure.2C_check"></a>Install, configure, check</h3>
<p>Because PL/Java, by design, runs entirely in the backend process created
for each connection to PostgreSQL, to configure it does not require any
cluster-wide actions such as stopping or restarting the server, or editing
the configuration file; any necessary settings can be made in SQL over
an ordinary connection.</p>
<p><i>Caution: if you are installing a new, little-tested PL/Java build, be aware
that in the unexpected case of a crash, the <code>postmaster</code> will kick other
sessions out of the database for a moment to verify integrity, and then let
them reconnect. If that would be disruptive, it may be best to <code>initdb</code> a
new cluster in some temporary location and test PL/Java there, installing to
a production server only when satisfied.</i></p>
<p>After connecting to the desired database (the connection must be as a
PostgreSQL superuser), the commands for first-time PL/Java setup are:</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>SET client_min_messages TO NOTICE; -- or anything finer (INFO, DEBUG, ...)
SET pljava.libjvm_location TO ' use the libjvm path here ';
SET pljava.module_path TO ' use the pljava and pljava-api jar paths here ';
LOAD ' use the PL/Java native library path here ';
</code></pre></div>
<p>(The <code>client_min_messages</code> setting is only to ensure you do not miss
the <code>NOTICE</code> message in case of success.) If you see</p>

<div class="source">
<pre><code>NOTICE: PL/Java loaded
</code></pre></div>
<p>then you are ready to test some PL/Java functions, such as the ones
in the <a href="../examples/examples.html"><code>examples.jar</code> supplied in the build</a>.</p>
<p>Although typically only <code>pljava.libjvm_location</code> and <code>pljava.module_path</code> need
to be right for PL/Java to function, there is a
<a href="../use/variables.html">reference to PL/Java configuration variables</a> if you need it.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Choosing_where_to_place_the_files"></a>Choosing where to place the files</h3>
<p>Exactly where you place the files, and what pathnames you use in the
above commands, can depend on your situation:</p>
<ul>

<li>Are you a superuser on the OS where PostgreSQL is installed (or are you
a distribution maintainer building a PL/Java package for that platform)?</li>
<li>Are you not an OS superuser, but you have PostgreSQL superuser rights and
OS permissions as the user that runs <code>postgres</code>?</li>
<li>Do you have only PostgreSQL superuser rights, no ability to write locations
owned by the user <code>postgres</code> runs as, but the ability to write some
locations that user can read?</li>
<li>Do you have PostgreSQL superuser rights and want to quickly test that you have
built a working PL/Java?</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this page will cover those cases. First, the quick check.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="A_quick_install_check"></a>A quick install check</h3>
<p>For a quick sanity test, there is no need to move the built files to more
permanent locations, as long as the build tree location and permissions are
such that the PostgreSQL backend can read them where they are. Use those
pathnames directly in the <code>SET</code> and <code>LOAD</code> commands.</p>
<p>For the lowest-impact quick test, begin a transaction first, load PL/Java
and run <a href="../examples/examples.html">any tests you like</a>, then roll the transaction back.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="OS_superuser_or_distribution_maintainer"></a>OS superuser or distribution maintainer</h3>
<p>If you fall in this category, you can minimize configuration within
PostgreSQL by placing the built files into standard locations,
so <code>SET</code> commands are not needed for PostgreSQL to find them. For example,
if the PL/Java native library is copied into the PostgreSQL <code>$libdir</code>
(shown by <code>pg_config</code> as <code>PKGLIBDIR</code>), then the <code>LOAD</code> command can be
given just the basename of the file instead of a full path. Or, if
<code>dynamic_library_path</code> is already set, the file can be placed in any
directory on that list for the same effect.</p>
<p>If the <code>pljava-${project.version}.jar</code> and <code>pljava-api-${project.version}.jar</code>
files are placed in the default location
(typically a <code>pljava</code> subdirectory of the PostgreSQL &#x201c;share&#x201d; directory), then
<code>pljava.module_path</code> will not need to be set.</p>
<p>The self-extracting jar file produced by the build, assuming it is run with
adequate permission, will extract the files into appropriate locations
determined by querying <code>pg_config</code> on the target system. If that system
may have more than one PostgreSQL installation and you wish to control
which one the files get installed into, pass the full path to that
installation's <code>pg_config</code> executable with <code>-Dpgconfig=</code> on that
<code>java -jar ...</code> command line. (In more difficult cases, each category
of file location, such as <code>pgconfig.sharedir</code>, can be separately overridden
on the command line.)</p>
<p><b>If you are a distribution maintainer</b> packaging PL/Java for a certain
platform, and you know or control that platform's conventions for where
the Java <code>libjvm</code> should be found, please supply that full path on the <code>mvn</code>
command line with <code>-Dpljava.libjvmdefault=</code> to make it the default for
<code>pljava.libjvm_location</code>, so users on that platform can see a working PL/Java
with no need to set that variable in the usual case. That tip and more are
covered
in <a href="../build/package.html">packaging PL/Java for a software distribution</a>.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="PostgreSQL_superuser_with_access_as_user_running_postgres"></a>PostgreSQL superuser with access as user running postgres</h3>
<p>If you are not a superuser on the OS, you may not be able to place the
PL/Java files in the default locations PostgreSQL was built with.
If you have permissions as the user running <code>postgres</code>, you might choose
locations in a directory associated with that user, such as the <code>DATADIR</code>,
and set the <code>pljava.*</code> variables to point to them. Use a <code>LOAD</code> command
with the full path of the native library, or set <code>dynamic_library_path</code> to
include its location, and give only the basename to <code>LOAD</code>.</p>
<p>If you would rather ensure that the user running <code>postgres</code>, if compromised,
could not modify these files, then the next case will be more appropriate.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="PostgreSQL_superuser.2C_OS_user_distinct_from_the_user_running_postgres"></a>PostgreSQL superuser, OS user distinct from the user running postgres</h3>
<p>In this case, simply place the files in any location where you can make them
readable by the user running <code>postgres</code>, and set the <code>pljava.*</code> variables
accordingly.</p></section></section>
