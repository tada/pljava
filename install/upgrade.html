<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Upgrading_the_PLJava_version_in_a_database"></a>Upgrading the PL/Java version in a database</h2>
<p>PL/Java performs an upgrade installation if there is already an <tt>sqlj</tt> schema with tables that match a known PL/Java schema from version 1.3.0 or later. It will convert, preserving data, to the current schema if necessary.</p>
<p><i>Remember that PL/Java runs independently in each database session where it is in use. Older PL/Java versions active in other sessions can be disrupted by the schema change.</i></p>
<p>A trial installation of a PL/Java update can be done in a transaction, and rolled back if desired, leaving the schema as it was. Any concurrent sessions with active older PL/Java versions will not be disrupted by the altered schema as long as the transaction remains open, <i>but they may block for the duration, so whatever testing will be done within the transaction should be done quickly if that could be an issue</i>.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Upgrading_outside_the_extension_framework"></a>Upgrading, outside the extension framework</h3>
<p>On PostgreSQL pre-9.1, or whenever PL/Java has not been installed with <tt>CREATE EXTENSION</tt>, it can be updated with a <tt>LOAD</tt> command just as in a fresh installation. This must be done in a fresh session (in which nothing has caused PL/Java to load since establishing the connection).</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Upgrading_within_the_extension_framework"></a>Upgrading, within the extension framework</h3>
<p>On PostgreSQL 9.1 or later where PL/Java has been installed with <tt>CREATE EXTENSION</tt>, it can be updated with <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-alterextension.html"><tt>ALTER EXTENSION pljava UPDATE</tt></a>, as long as <tt>SELECT * FROM pg_extension_update_paths('pljava')</tt> shows a one-step path from the version currently installed to the version desired.</p>
<p>As with the <tt>LOAD</tt> method, an <tt>ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE</tt> must be done in a fresh session, before anything has loaded PL/Java; this also precludes an update with a multi-step path in a single command, but the intent is to always provide a one-step path between <i>released</i> versions.</p>
<p>If you will be following development (<tt>SNAPSHOT</tt>) versions, the installation method using <tt>LOAD</tt> may be simpler, as updates between snapshots with the same version string make no sense to the extension framework.</p></div></div>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Binary_upgrading_with_pg_upgrade"></a>Binary upgrading with <tt>pg_upgrade</tt></h3>
<p>Using the <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html"><tt>pg_upgrade</tt></a> tool <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/release-9-0.html#AEN103668">contributed to PostgreSQL in 9.0</a>, an entire PostgreSQL cluster can be upgraded to a later major version in a more direct process than the dump to SQL and reload formerly required. The binary upgrade is possible as long as the cluster and databases meet certain requirements, which should be studied in the <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html"><tt>pg_upgrade</tt> manual page</a> version for the PostgreSQL release being upgraded <i>to</i>.</p>
<p>PL/Java adds a few additional considerations:</p>

<ul>
  
<li>
<p><tt>pg_upgrade</tt> will check in advance that every loadable module used in the old cluster can be loaded in the new cluster, but the schema and data will be copied over by <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> itself. That means that a PL/Java build for the new PostgreSQL version must be <i>installed in the directory structure</i> for the new cluster before running <tt>pg_upgrade</tt>, but <i>not</i> installed into any databases (the new cluster should not have had any non-system objects created yet).</p></li>
  
<li>
<p>In the steps of <a href="install.html">Installing PL/Java</a>, that means that the self-extracting <tt>java -jar ...</tt> command must have been run (or the equivalent package-installation command, if you are getting PL/Java through a packaging system for your OS), but no <tt>CREATE EXTENSION</tt> or <tt>LOAD</tt> command should have been run to configure it in any database. If using the extracting jar, to be sure of installing it to the right cluster, add <tt>-Dpgconfig=</tt><i>pgconfigpath</i> at the end, where <i>pgconfigpath</i> is the full path to the <i>new</i> cluster&#x2019;s <tt>pg_config</tt> executable.</p></li>
  
<li>
<p>PL/Java releases before 1.5.1 were not aware of <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> operation. To avoid possible errors during the upgrade involving OID or object clashes, the PL/Java release installed for the new cluster should be 1.5.1 or later.</p></li>
  
<li>
<p>When <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> tests that all needed modules are present, it expects the names to match. The PL/Java module name includes the PL/Java version, so the versions installed in the old and new clusters should be the same. Given that 1.5.1 or later should be installed in the new cluster, if any databases in the old cluster are using an older PL/Java version, PL/Java should be upgraded in each (as described at the top of this page) before running <tt>pg_upgrade</tt>. To be sure of installing a newer PL/Java build into the old cluster, if using the extracting jar, add <tt>-Dpgconfig=</tt><i>oldpgconfigpath</i> at the end of the <tt>java -jar ...</tt> command line, with <i>oldpgconfigpath</i> the full path to the old cluster&#x2019;s <tt>pg_config</tt> executable.</p></li>
</ul></div></div>
