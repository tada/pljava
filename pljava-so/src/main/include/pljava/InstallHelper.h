 * a transaction, and must not do things that could throw errors and disrupt
 * the rollback. That's a very big BUT, because the init sequencer can do all
 * sorts of things that might throw errors. On the other hand, it doesn't NEED
 * to be reentered at all: because that is purely a user-experience convenience,
 * we are totally free to skip it if the assign hook has been called in the
