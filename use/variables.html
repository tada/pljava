<h1>PL/Java configuration variable reference</h1>
<p>These PostgreSQL configuration variables can influence PL/Java's operation:</p>
<dl>

<dt><code>check_function_bodies</code></dt>
<dd>Although not technically a PL/Java variable, <code>check_function_bodies</code> affects
how strictly PL/Java validates a new function at the time of a
<code>CREATE FUNCTION</code> (or when installing a jar file with <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>
among its deployment actions). With <code>check_function_bodies</code> set to <code>on</code>,
PL/Java will make sure that the referenced class and method can be loaded
and resolved. If the referenced class depends on classes in other jars,
those other jars must be already installed and on the class path, so
loading jars with dependencies in the wrong order can incur validation
errors. With <code>check_function_bodies</code> set to <code>off</code>, only basic syntax is
checked at <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code> time, so it is possible to declare functions
or install jars in any order, postponing any errors about unresolved
dependencies until later when the functions are used.</dd>
<dt><code>dynamic_library_path</code></dt>
<dd>Another non-PL/Java variable, <code>dynamic_library_path</code> influences
where the PL/Java native code object (<code>.so</code>, <code>.dll</code>, <code>.bundle</code>, etc.) can
be found, if the full path is not given to the <code>LOAD</code> command.</dd>
<dt><code>server_encoding</code></dt>
<dd>Another non-PL/Java variable, this affects all text/character strings
exchanged between PostgreSQL and Java. <code>UTF8</code> as the database and server
encoding is strongly recommended. If a different encoding is used, it
should be any of the available <i>fully defined</i> character encodings. In
particular, the PostgreSQL pseudo-encoding <code>SQL_ASCII</code> does not fully
define what any values outside ASCII represent; it is usable, but
<a href="charsets.html#Using_PLJava_with_server_encoding_SQL_ASCII">subject to limitations</a>.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.debug</code></dt>
<dd>A boolean variable that, if set <code>on</code>, stops the process on first entry to
PL/Java before the Java virtual machine is started. The process cannot
proceed until a debugger is attached and used to set the static
<code>Backend.c</code> variable <code>pljavaDebug</code> to zero. This may be useful for debugging
PL/Java problems only seen in the context of some larger application
that can't be stepped through.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.enable</code></dt>
<dd>Setting this variable <code>off</code> prevents PL/Java startup from completing, until
the variable is later set <code>on</code>. It can be useful in some debugging settings.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.implementors</code></dt>
<dd>A list of &#x201c;implementor names&#x201d; that PL/Java will recognize when processing
<a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/tada/pljava/wiki/Sql-deployment-descriptor">deployment descriptors</a> inside a jar file being installed or
removed. Deployment descriptors can contain commands with no implementor
name, which will be executed always, or with an implementor name, executed
only on a system recognizing that name. By default, this list contains only
the entry <code>postgresql</code>. A deployment descriptor that contains commands with
other implementor names can achieve a rudimentary kind of conditional
execution if earlier commands adjust this list of names. <i>Commas separate
elements of this list. Elements that are not regular identifiers need to be
surrounded by double-quotes; prior to PostgreSQL 11, that syntax can be used
directly in a <code>SET</code> command, while in 11 and after, such a value needs to be
a (single-quoted) string explicitly containing the double quotes.</i></dd>
<dt><code>pljava.java_thread_pg_entry</code></dt>
<dd>A choice of <code>allow</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>block</code>, or <code>throw</code> controlling PL/Java's thread
management. Java makes heavy use of threading, while PostgreSQL may not be
accessed by multiple threads concurrently. PL/Java's historical behavior is
<code>allow</code>, which serializes access by Java threads into PostgreSQL, allowing
a different Java thread in only when the current one calls or returns into
Java. PL/Java formerly made some use of Java object finalizers, which
required this approach, as finalizers run in their own thread.
<p>PL/Java itself no longer requires the ability for any thread to access
PostgreSQL other than the original main thread. User code developed for
PL/Java, however, may still rely on that ability. To test whether it does,
the <code>error</code> or <code>throw</code> setting can be used here, and any attempt by a Java
thread other
than the main one to enter PostgreSQL will incur an exception (and stack
trace, written to the server's standard error channel). When confident that
there is no code that will need to enter PostgreSQL except on the main
thread, the <code>block</code> setting can be used. That will eliminate PL/Java's
frequent lock acquisitions and releases when the main thread crosses between
PostgreSQL and Java, and will simply indefinitely block any other Java
thread that attempts to enter PostgreSQL. This is an efficient setting, but
can lead to blocked threads or a deadlocked backend if used with code that
does attempt to access PG from more than one thread. (A JMX client, like
JConsole, can identify the blocked threads, should that occur.)</p>
<p>The <code>throw</code> setting is like <code>error</code> but more efficient: under the <code>error</code>
setting, attempted entry by the wrong thread is detected in the native C
code, only after a lock operation and call through JNI. Under the <code>throw</code>
setting, the lock operations are elided and an entry attempt by the wrong
thread results in no JNI call and an exception thrown directly in Java.</p></dd>
<dt><code>pljava.libjvm_location</code></dt>
<dd>Used by PL/Java to load the Java runtime. The full path to a <code>libjvm</code> shared
object (filename typically ending with <code>.so</code>, <code>.dll</code>, or <code>.dylib</code>).
To determine the proper setting, see <a href="../install/locatejvm.html">finding the <code>libjvm</code> library</a>.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.module_path</code></dt>
<dd>The module path to be passed to the Java application class loader. The default
is computed from the PostgreSQL configuration and is usually correct, unless
PL/Java's files have been installed in unusual locations. If it must be set
explicitly, there must be at least two (and usually only two) entries, the
PL/Java API jar file and the PL/Java internals jar file. To determine the
proper setting, see
<a href="../install/locate.html">finding the files produced by a PL/Java build</a>.
<p>If additional modular jars are added to the module path,
<code>--add-modules</code> in <a href="../install/vmoptions.html#Adding_to_the_set_of_readable_modules"><code>pljava.vmoptions</code></a> will make them readable by
PL/Java code.</p>
<p>For more on PL/Java's &#x201c;module path&#x201d; and &#x201c;class path&#x201d;, see
<a href="jpms.html">PL/Java and the Java Platform Module System</a>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>pljava.policy_urls</code></dt>
<dd>A list of URLs to Java security <a href="policy.html">policy files</a> determining
the permissions available to PL/Java functions. Each URL should be
enclosed in double quotes; any double quote that is literally part of
the URL may be represented as two double quotes (in SQL style) or as
<code>%22</code> in the URL convention. Between double-quoted URLs, a comma is the
list delimiter.
<p>The Java installation's <code>java.security</code> file usually defines two policy
file locations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>A systemwide policy from the Java vendor, sufficient for the Java runtime
itself to function as expected</li>
<li>A per-user location, where a policy file, if found, can add to the policy
from the systemwide file.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list in <code>pljava.policy_urls</code> will modify the list from the Java
installation, by default after the first entry, keeping the Java-supplied
systemwide policy but replacing the customary per-user file (there
probably isn't one in the home of the <code>postgres</code> user, and if there is
it is probably not tailored for PL/Java).</p>
<p>Any entry in this list can start with <i>n</i><code>=</code> (inside the quotes) for a
positive integer <i>n</i>, to specify which entry of Java's policy location list
it will replace (entry 1 is the systemwide policy, 2 the customary user
location). URLs not prefixed with <i>n</i><code>=</code> will follow consecutively. If the
first entry is not so prefixed, <code>2=</code> is assumed.</p>
<p>A final entry of <code>=</code> (in the required double quotes) will prevent
use of any remaining entries in the Java site-configured list.</p>
<p>This setting defaults to
<code>&quot;file:${org.postgresql.sysconfdir}/pljava.policy&quot;,&quot;=&quot;</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.release_lingering_savepoints</code></dt>
<dd>How the return from a PL/Java function will treat any savepoints created
within it that have not been explicitly either released (the savepoint
analog of &#x201c;committed&#x201d;) or rolled back and released.
If <code>off</code> (the default), they will be rolled back. If <code>on</code>, they will be
released/committed. If possible, rather than setting this variable <code>on</code>,
it would be safer to fix the function to release its own savepoints when
appropriate.
<p>A savepoint continues to exist after being used as a rollback target.
This is JDBC-specified behavior, but was not PL/Java's behavior before
release 1.5.3, so code may exist that did not explicitly release or roll
back a savepoint after rolling back to it once. To avoid a behavior change
for such code, PL/Java will always release a savepoint that is still live
at function return, regardless of this setting, if the savepoint has already
been rolled back.</p></dd>
<dt><code>pljava.statement_cache_size</code></dt>
<dd>The number of most-recently-prepared statements PL/Java will keep open.</dd>
<dt><code>pljava.vmoptions</code></dt>
<dd>Any options to be passed to the Java runtime, in the same form as the
documented options for the <code>java</code> command (<a class="externalLink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html">windows</a>,
<a class="externalLink" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html">Unix family</a>). The string is split on whitespace unless found
between single or double quotes. A backslash treats the following
character literally, but the backslash itself remains in the string,
so not all values can be expressed with these rules. If the server
encoding is not <code>UTF8</code>, only ASCII characters should be used in
<code>pljava.vmoptions</code>. The exact quoting and encoding rules for this variable
may be adjusted in a future PL/Java version.
<p>Some important settings can be made here, and are described on the
<a href="../install/vmoptions.html">VM options page</a>.</p></dd>
