/**
 * The {@code NUMERIC} type's PostgreSQL semantics: a sign (or indication
 * that the value is NaN, + infinity, or - infinity), a display scale,
 * a weight, and zero or more base-ten-thousand digits.
 *<p>
 * This data type can have a type modifier that specifies a maximum
 * precision (total number of base-ten digits to retain) and a maximum scale
 * (how many of those base-ten digits are right of the decimal point).
 *<p>
 * A curious feature of the type is that, when a type modifier is specified,
 * the value becomes "anchored" to the decimal point: all of its decimal
 * digits must be within <var>precision</var> places of the decimal point,
 * or an error is reported. This rules out the kind of values that can crop
 * up in physics, for example, where there might be ten digits of precision
 * but those are twenty places away from the decimal point. This limitation
 * apparently follows from the ISO SQL definitions of the precision and
 * scale.
 *<p>
 * However, when PostgreSQL {@code NUMERIC} is used with no type modifier,
 * such values are not rejected, and are stored efficiently, just as you
 * would expect, keeping only the digits that are needed and adjusting
 * <var>weight</var> for the distance to the decimal point.
 *<p>
 * In mapping to and from a Java representation, extra care may be needed
 * if that capability is to be preserved.

	 * Constructs a representation <var>T</var> from the components

	 *<p>
	 * A note about <var>displayScale</var>: when positive, it is information,
	 * stored with the PostgreSQL value, that conveys how far (right of the
	 * units place) the least significant decimal digit of the intended value
	 * falls.
	 *<p>
	 * An <var>apparentScale</var> can also be computed:
	 *<pre>
	 *  apparentScale = (1 + weight - base10000Digits.length) * (- DEC_DIGITS)
	 *</pre>
	 * This computation has a simple meaning, and gives the distance, right of
	 * the units place, of the least-significant decimal digit in the stored
	 * representation. When negative, of course, it means that least stored
	 * digit falls left of the units place.
	 *<p>
	 * Because of the {@code DEC_DIGITS} factor, <var>apparentScale</var>
	 * computed this way will always be a multiple of four, the next such (in
	 * the direction of more significant digits) from the position of the
	 * actual least significant digit in the value. So <var>apparentScale</var>
	 * may exceed <var>displayScale</var> by as much as three, and, if so,
	 * <var>displayScale</var> should be used in preference, to avoid
	 * overstating the value's significant figures.
	 *<p>
	 * Likewise, if <var>displayScale</var> is positive, it should be used even
	 * if it exceeds <var>apparentScale</var>. In that case, it conveys that
	 * PostgreSQL knows additional digits are significant, even though they were
	 * zero and it did not store them.
	 *<p>
	 * However, the situation when <var>displayScale</var> is zero is less
	 * clear-cut, because PostgreSQL simply disallows it ever to be negative.
	 * This clamping of <var>displayScale</var> loses information, such that a
	 * value with <var>displayScale</var> zero and <var>apparentScale</var>
	 * negative may represent any of:
	 *<ul>
	 * <li>A limited-precision value with non-significant trailing zeros (from
	 * -<var>apparentScale</var> to as many as -<var>apparentScale</var>+3 of
	 * them)</li>
	 * <li>A precise integer, all of whose -<var>apparentScale</var> non-stored
	 * significant digits just happened to be zeros</li>
	 * <li>or anything in between.</li>
	 *</ul>
	 *<p>
	 * That these cases can't be distinguished is inherent in PostgreSQL's
	 * representation of the type, and any implementation of this interface will
	 * need to make and document a choice of how to proceed. If the choice is
	 * to rely on <var>apparentScale</var>, then the fact that it is a multiple
	 * of four and may overstate, by up to three, the number of significant
	 * digits (as known, perhaps, to a human who assigned the value) has to be
	 * lived with; when <var>displayScale</var> is clamped to zero there simply
	 * isn't enough information to do better.
	 *<p>
	 * For example, consider this adapter applied to the result of:
	 *<pre>
	 * SELECT 6.62607015e-34 AS planck, 6.02214076e23 AS avogadro;
	 *</pre>
	 *<p>
	 * Planck's constant (a small number defined with nine significant places)
	 * will be presented with <var>displayScale</var>=42, <var>weight</var>=-9,
	 * and <var>base10000Digits</var>=[662, 6070, 1500].
	 * Because <var>apparentScale</var> works out to 44 (placing the least
	 * stored digit 44 places right of the decimal point, a multiple of 4) but
	 * <var>displayScale</var> is only 42, it is clear that the two trailing
	 * zeroes in the last element are non-significant, and the value has not
	 * eleven but only nine significant figures.
	 *<p>
	 * In contrast, Avogadro's number (a large one, defined also with nine
	 * significant places) will arrive with <var>weight</var>=5 and
	 * <var>base10000Digits</var>=[6022, 1407, 6000], but
	 * <var>displayScale</var> will not be -15; it is clamped to zero instead.
	 * If an implementation of this contract chooses to compute
	 * <var>apparentScale</var>, that will be -12 (the next larger multiple of
	 * four) and the value will seem to have gained three extra significant
	 * figures. On the other hand, in an implementation that takes the
	 * clamped-to-zero <var>displayScale</var> at face value, the number will
	 * seem to have gained fifteen extra significant figures.
	 * @param kind POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, POSINFINITY, NEGINFINITY, or NAN
	 * @param displayScale nominal precision, nonnegative; the number of
	 * <em>base ten</em> digits right of the decimal point. If this exceeds
	 * the number of right-of-decimal digits determined by the stored value,
	 * the excess represents a number of trailing decimal zeroes that are
	 * significant but trimmed from storage.
	 * @param weight indicates the power of ten thousand which the first
	 * base ten-thousand digit is taken is taken to represent. If the array
	 * <var>base10000Digits</var> has length one, and that one digit has the
	 * value 3, and <var>weight</var> is zero, the value is 3. If
	 * <var>weight</var> is 1, the value is 30000, and if <var>weight</var>
	 * is -1, the value is 0.0003.
	 * @param base10000Digits each array element is a nonnegative value not
	 * above 9999, representing a single digit of a base-ten-thousand
	 * number. The element at index zero is the most significant. The caller
