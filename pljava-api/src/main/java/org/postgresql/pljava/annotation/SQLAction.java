 * in the order supplied. Strings from different SQLAction annotations, and
 * generated code for functions, will be assembled in an order that can be
 * influenced by 'provides' and 'requires' labels. No snippet X will be
 * emitted ahead of any snippets that provide what X requires. The "remove"
 * actions will be assembled in the reverse of that order.
