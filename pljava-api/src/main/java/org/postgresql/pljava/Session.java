/**
 * A Session brings together some useful methods and data for the current
 * database session. It provides a set of attributes (a
 * {@code String} to {@code Object} map). Until PL/Java 1.2.0, its attribute
 * store had transactional behavior (i.e., the data
 * added since the last commit would be lost on a transaction rollback, or kept
 * after a commit), but in 1.2.0 and later, it has not, and has functioned as a
 * {@code Map} with no awareness of transactions. Java already provides those,
 * so the attribute-related methods of {@code Session} are now deprecated.
 * 
 * {@code TransactionListeners} and {@code SavepointListeners} are available for
 * use by any code that needs to synchronize some state with PostgreSQL
 * transactions.
