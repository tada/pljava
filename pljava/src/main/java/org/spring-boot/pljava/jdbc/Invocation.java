/**
 * One invocation, from PostgreSQL, of functionality implemented using PL/Java.
 *<p>
 * This class is the Java counterpart of the {@code struct Invocation_} in the
 * C code, but while there is a new stack-allocated C structure on every entry
 * from PG to PL/Java, no instance of this class is created unless requested
 * (with {@link #current current()}; once requested, a reference to it is saved
 * in the C struct for the duration of the invocation.
 *<p>
 * One further piece of magic applies to set-returning functions. Under the
 * value-per-call protocol, there is technically a new entry into PL/Java, and
 * a new C {@code Invocation_} struct, for every row to be returned, but that
 * low-level complication is hidden at this level: a single instance of this
 * class, if once requested, will be remembered throughout the value-per-call
 * sequence of calls.

	/**
	 * Recent exception representing a PostgreSQL {@code ereport(ERROR} that has
	 * been thrown in Java but not yet resolved (as by rollback of the
	 * transaction or subtransaction / savepoint).
	 *<p>
	 * Mutation happens on "the PG thread".
	 *<p>
	 * This field should be non-null when and only when {@code errorOccurred}
	 * is true in the C {@code Invocation} struct. Both are set when such an
	 * exception is thrown, and cleared by
	 * {@link #clearErrorCondition clearErrorCondition}.
	 *<p>
	 * One static field suffices, not one per invocation nesting level, because
	 * it will always be recognized and cleared on invocation exit (to any
	 * possible outer nest level), and {@code errorOccurred} is meant to prevent
	 * calling into any PostgreSQL functions that could reach an inner nest
	 * level. (On reflection, that reasoning ought to apply also to
	 * {@code errorOccurred} itself, but that has been the way it is for decades
	 * and this can be added without changing that.)
	 *<p>
	 * On the first creation of a {@link ServerException ServerException}, that
	 * exception is stored here. If any later call into PostgreSQL is thwarted
	 * by finding {@code errorOccurred} true, the {@code ServerException} stored
	 * here will be replaced by an
	 * {@link UnhandledPGException UnhandledPGException} that has the original
	 * {@code ServerException} as its {@link Throwable#cause cause} and the new
	 * exception will be thrown. Once this field holds an
	 * {@code UnhandledPGException}, it will be reused and rethrown unchanged if
	 * further attempts to call into PostgreSQL are made.
	 *<p>
	 * At invocation exit, the C {@code popInvocation} code knows whether the
	 * exit is normal or exceptional. If the exit is normal but
	 * {@code errorOccurred} is true, that means the exiting Java function
	 * caught a {@code ServerException} but without rethrowing it (or some
	 * higher-level exception) and also without resolving it (as with a
	 * rollback). That is a bug in the Java function, and the exception stored
	 * here can have its stacktrace logged. If it is the original
	 * {@code ServerException}, the logging will be skipped at levels quieter
	 * than {@code DEBUG1}. If the exception here is already
	 * {@code UnhandledPGException}, then at least one attempted PostgreSQL
	 * operation is known to have been thwarted because of it, and a stacktrace
	 * will be generated at {@code WARNING} level.
	 *<p>
	 * If the invocation is being popped exceptionally, the exception probably
	 * is this one, or has this one in its cause chain, and longstanding code
	 * in {@code JNICalls.c::endCall} will have generated that stack trace at
	 * level {@code DEBUG1}. Should that not be the case, then a stacktrace of
	 * this exception can be obtained from {@code popInvocation} by bumping the
	 * level to {@code DEBUG2}.
	 *<p>
	 * Public access so factory methods of {@code ServerException} and
	 * {@code UnhandledPGException}, in another package, can access it.
