/**
 * Like a {@link MarkableSequenceInputStream} but for characters.
 *<p>
 * This class implements {@code mark} and {@code reset} by calling the
 * corresponding methods on the underlying readers; it does not add buffering
 * or have any means of providing {@code mark} and {@code reset} support if
 * the underlying readers do not.
 *<p>
 * As with {@code SequenceInputStream}, each underlying reader, when completely
 * read and no longer needed, is closed to free resources. This instance itself
 * will remain in "open at EOF" condition until explicitly closed, but does not
 * prevent reclamation of the underlying readers.
 *<p>
 * Unlike {@code SequenceInputStream}, this class can keep underlying readers
 * open, after fully reading them, if a {@code mark} has been set, so that
 * {@code reset} will be possible. When a mark is no longer needed, it can be
 * canceled (by calling {@code mark} with a {@code readlimit} of 0) to again
 * allow the underlying readers to be reclaimed as soon as possible.
