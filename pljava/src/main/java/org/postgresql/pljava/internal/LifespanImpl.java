 * Subclasses are likely to maintain cache mappings from addresses of PostgreSQL
 * native objects to instances. Such mappings must hold strong references to the
 * instances, because any {@code LifespanImpl} instance can serve as the
 * head of a list of {@code DualState} objects, which are
 * {@link Reference Reference} instances, and the Java runtime will cease
 * tracking those if they themselves are not kept strongly reachable. This
 * requirement is acceptable, because all instances represent bounded lifespans
 * that end with explicit invalidation and decaching; that's what they're for,
