/**
 * Base class for object state with corresponding Java and native components.
 *<p>
 * A {@code DualState} object connects some state that exists in the JVM
 * as well as some native/PostgreSQL resources. It will 'belong' to some Java
 * object that holds a strong reference to it, and this state object is,
 * in turn, a {@link WeakReference} to that object. Java state may be held in
 * that object (if it needs only to be freed by the garbage collector when
 * unreachable), or in this object if it needs some more specific cleanup.
 * Native state will be referred to by this object.
 *<p>
 * These interesting events are possible in the life cycle of a
 * {@code DualState} object:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is explicitly closed by the Java code using it. It, and any associated
 * native state, should be released.</li>
 * <li>It is found unreachable by the Java garbage collector. Again, any
 * associated state should be released.</li>
 * <li>Its associated native state is released or invalidated (such as by exit
 * of a corresponding context). If the object is still reachable from Java, it
 * must throw an exception for any future attempted access to its
 * native state.</li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * A subclass overrides the {@link #javaStateReleased javaStateReleased},
 * {@link #javaStateUnreachable javaStateUnreachable}, or
 * {@link #nativeStateReleased nativeStateReleased} methods, respectively,
 * to add behavior for those life cycle events.
 *<p>
 * A subclass calls {@link #releaseFromJava releaseFromJava} to signal an event
 * of the first kind. Events of the second kind are, naturally, detected by the
 * Java garbage collector. To detect events of the third kind, a lifespan
 * must be associated with the instance.
 *<p>
 * A parameter to the {@code DualState} constructor is a {@code Lifespan}. A
 * {@code nativeStateReleased} event occurs when the corresponding
 * {@code Lifespan} is released in PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL {@code ResourceOwner}
 * and {@code MemoryContext} are two types of object that can serve
 * as lifespans. A PL/Java {@code Invocation} object may also be used, to mark
 * the lifespans of function arguments and other data expected to live at least
 * for the duration of a function call. The lifespan argument can be null,
 * for an object allocated in an immortal context and managed only by its
 * {@code javaStateReleased} or {@code javaStateUnreachable} methods.
 *<p>
 * Java code may execute in multiple threads, but PostgreSQL is not
 * multi-threaded; at any given time, there is no more than one thread that may
 * safely make JNI calls into PostgreSQL routines (for that thread,
 * {@code Backend.threadMayEnterPG()} returns true). Depending on the setting of
 * the {@code pljava.java_thread_pg_entry} PostgreSQL configuration variable,
 * that may be the same one thread for the duration of a session, or it may be
 * possible for one thread to relinquish that status and another thread to take
 * it: for the {@code pljava.java_thread_pg_entry} setting {@code allow}, the
 * status is represented by holding the object monitor on
 * {@code Backend.THREADLOCK}, and {@code Backend.threadMayEnterPG()} returns
 * true for whatever thread holds it. Under that setting, there can be moments
 * when {@code Backend.threadMayEnterPG()} is not true for any thread, if one
 * has released the monitor and no other thread has yet acquired it. For brevity
 * in what follows, "the PG thread" will be used to mean whatever thread, at a
 * given moment, would observe {@code Backend.threadMayEnterPG()} to return
 * true.
 *<p>
 * Some methods of {@code DualState} and subclasses may be called from any Java
 * thread, while some must be called from the PG thread. The life-cycle
 * callbacks, {@code javaStateReleased}, {@code javaStateUnreachable}, and
 * {@code nativeStateReleased}, are called by the implementation, and always
 * on the PG thread.
 *<p>
 * The Java Memory Model imposes strict conditions for updates to memory state
 * made in one thread to be visible to other threads. Methods that are known to
 * be called only on the PG thread can sidestep those complexities, at least
 * to the extent that they manipulate only data structures not accessed in other
 * threads. This is true even under the {@code pljava.java_thread_pg_entry}
 * setting {@code allow}, where "the PG thread" may not always be the same
 * thread. Because a Java synchronization event is involved whenever
 * "the PG thread" changes, unbroken visibility is assured, just as it would be
 * in one unchanging thread, so one can say "the PG thread" for convenience and
 * without loss of generality.
 *<p>
 * For the {@code nativeStateReleased} lifecycle event, rules for memory
 * visibility are not enough; a mechanism for mutual exclusion is needed. The
 * callback is made on the PG thread from PostgreSQL code that is in the process
 * of invalidating the native state, and will do so once the callback returns.
 * If any other Java thread is actively referring to that native state, there is
 * no choice but to block the PG thread making the callback until such other
 * threads are no longer relying on the native state.
 *<p>
 * To that end, the {@link #pin pin} and {@link #unpin unpin} methods are
 * provided, and must be used to surround any block of code that accesses the
 * native state:
 *<pre>
 *pin();
 *try
 *{
 *    ... code that dereferences or relies on
 *    a valid native state ...
 *}
 *finally
 *{
 *    unpin();
 *}
 *</pre>
 *<p>
 * Pins are lightweight, nonexclusive (any number of threads may simultaneously
 * pin the same {@code DualState} instance), and reentrant (a single thread may
 * obtain and release nested pins on the same instance). The code protected by a
 * pin is ideally a short sequence representing a simple operation (reading a
 * value, or refilling a small buffer with data) on the native state. The chief
 * purpose of holding a pin is to hold off the possible invalidation of the
 * native state until the pin is released.
 *<p>
 * If either the native state or the Java state has been released already (by
 * the lifespan callback or an explicit call to {@code releaseFromJava},
 * respectively), {@code pin()} will detect that and throw the appropriate
 * exception. Otherwise, the state is safe to make use of until {@code unpin}.
 * A subclass can customize the messages or {@code SQLSTATE} codes for the
 * exceptions {@code pin()} may throw, by overriding one or more of
 * {@link #identifierForMessage identifierForMessage},
 * {@link #invalidMessage invalidMessage},
 * {@link #releasedMessage releasedMessage},
 * {@link #invalidSqlState invalidSqlState}, or
 * {@link #releasedSqlState releasedSqlState}.
 *<p>
 * Code that holds a pin may safely act on components of the native state from
 * any thread, so long as the actions do not include native calls to PostgreSQL
 * routines (directly or transitively). Access to the native memory through a
 * direct byte buffer would be a permitted example, or even calls to JNI methods
 * to retrieve fields from C {@code struct}s or chase pointers through a data
 * structure, as long as only thread-safe routines from the C runtime are called
 * and no routines of PostgreSQL itself, and as long as the memory or structure
 * being accessed is known to be safe from modification by PostgreSQL while the
 * pin is held. In the future, PL/Java may one day have an annotation that can
 * be used to mark native methods that satisfy these limits; at present, there
 * has been no effort to segregate them into those that do and those that don't.
 * Native methods that may (under any circumstances!) invoke PG routines must
 * be invoked on the PG thread.
 *<p>
 * The exclusive counterparts to {@code pin} and {@code unpin} are
 * {@link #lock lock} and {@link #unlock(int,boolean) unlock}, which are not
 * expected to be used as widely. The chief use of {@code lock}/{@code unlock}
 * is around the call to {@code nativeStateReleased} when handling a lifespan
 * callback from PostgreSQL. They can be used in subclasses to surround
 * modifications to the state, as needed. A {@code lock} will block until all
 * earlier-acquired pins are released; subsequent pins block until the lock is
 * released. Only the PG thread may use {@code lock}/{@code unlock}. An
 * {@code upgrade} argument to {@code lock} allows the lock to be acquired
 * when the PG thread already holds a pin; it should be specified
 * only when inspection of the code identifies a nearby enclosing pin and
 * confirms that the planned locked actions will not break the pinning code's
 * assumptions. Pins can be freely acquired by the PG thread while it holds a
 * lock; the coding convention's strict nesting assures they will all be
 * released before the lock is.
 *<p>
 * In an explicit call to {@code releaseFromJava}, which may be made from any
 * thread, the instance is immediately, atomically, flagged as released. No
 * subsequent pin will succeed. Pins already held are unaffected, so there must
 * be no changes made to the state, at the time {@code releaseFromJava} is
 * called, that could confuse any code that already holds a pin and is relying
 * on the state. Such changes must be made in the {@code javaStateReleased}
 * callback, which will execute only after release of the last pin, if any, and
 * always on the PG thread. If the last pin is released by a thread other than
 * the PG thread, the callback does not execute immediately, but via a queue
 * that is polled from the PG thread at convenient points.
 *<p>
 * Instances whose referents are found unreachable by Java's garbage collector
 * are placed on the same queue, so their {@code javaStateUnreachable} callbacks
 * will be executed on the PG thread when the queue is polled. The callbacks
 * should clean up any lingering native state.
 *<p>
 * As the callbacks are executed on the PG thread, any native calls they may
 * need to make into PostgreSQL are allowed without extra ceremony.
 *<p>
 * There are different abstract subclasses of {@code DualState} that wrap
 * different sorts of PostgreSQL native state, and encapsulate what needs to be
 * done when such state is released from the Java or native side. More such
 * subclasses can be added as needed.
 *<p>
 * A client class of {@code DualState} will typically contain a static nested
 * class that further extends one of these abstract subclasses, and the client
 * instance will hold a strong reference to an instance of that
 * {@code DualState} subclass constructed at the same time.
 *<p>
 * <strong>This class uses some private data structures, to track
 * created instances through their life cycles, that are not synchronized or
 * thread-safe.</strong> The design rests on the following requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The structures are only traversed or modified during:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Instance construction
 *  <li>Reference queue processing (instances found unreachable by Java's
 *  garbage collector, or enqueued following {@code releaseFromJava})
 *  <li>Exit of a lifespan's scope
 *  </ul>
 * <li>There is only one PG thread, or only one at a time.
 * <li>Construction of any {@code DualState} instance is to take place only on
 * the PG thread.
 * <li>Reference queue processing takes place only at chosen points where a
 * thread enters or exits native code, on the PG thread.
 * <li>Lifespan callbacks originate in native code, on the PG thread.
 * </ul>
