<div class="block">Base class for object state with corresponding Java and native components.
<p>
 A <code>DualState</code> object connects some state that exists in the JVM
 as well as some native/PostgreSQL resources. It will 'belong' to some Java
 object that holds a strong reference to it, and this state object is,
 in turn, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html" title="class or interface in java.lang.ref" class="external-link"><code>WeakReference</code></a> to that object. Java state may be held in
 that object (if it needs only to be freed by the garbage collector when
 unreachable), or in this object if it needs some more specific cleanup.
 Native state will be referred to by this object.
<p>
 These interesting events are possible in the life cycle of a
 <code>DualState</code> object:
 <ul>
 <li>It is explicitly closed by the Java code using it. It, and any associated
 native state, should be released.</li>
 <li>It is found unreachable by the Java garbage collector. Again, any
 associated state should be released.</li>
 <li>Its associated native state is released or invalidated (such as by exit
 of a corresponding context). If the object is still reachable from Java, it
 must throw an exception for any future attempted access to its
 native state.</li>
 </ul>
<p>
 A subclass overrides the <a href="#javaStateReleased(boolean)"><code>javaStateReleased</code></a>,
 <a href="#javaStateUnreachable(boolean)"><code>javaStateUnreachable</code></a>, or
 <a href="#nativeStateReleased(boolean)"><code>nativeStateReleased</code></a> methods, respectively,
 to add behavior for those life cycle events.
<p>
 A subclass calls <a href="#releaseFromJava()"><code>releaseFromJava</code></a> to signal an event
 of the first kind. Events of the second kind are, naturally, detected by the
 Java garbage collector. To detect events of the third kind, a resource owner
 must be associated with the instance.
<p>
 A parameter to the <code>DualState</code> constructor is a <code>ResourceOwner</code>,
 a PostgreSQL implementation concept introduced in PG 8.0. A
 <code>nativeStateReleased</code> event occurs when the corresponding
 <code>ResourceOwner</code> is released in PostgreSQL.
<p>
 However, this class does not require the <code>resourceOwner</code> parameter to
 be, in all cases, a pointer to a PostgreSQL <code>ResourceOwner</code>. It is
 treated simply as an opaque <code>long</code> value, to be compared to a value
 passed at release time (as if in a <code>ResourceOwner</code> callback). Other
 values (such as pointers to other allocated structures, which of course
 cannot match any PG <code>ResourceOwner</code> existing at the same time) can also
 be used. In PostgreSQL 9.5 and later, a <code>MemoryContext</code> could be used,
 with its address passed to a <code>MemoryContextCallback</code> for release. For
 state that is scoped to a single invocation of a PL/Java function, the
 address of the <code>Invocation</code> can be used. Such references can be
 considered "generalized" resource owners.
<p>
 Java code may execute in multiple threads, but PostgreSQL is not
 multi-threaded; at any given time, there is no more than one thread that may
 safely make JNI calls into PostgreSQL routines (for that thread,
 <code>Backend.threadMayEnterPG()</code> returns true). Depending on the setting of
 the <code>pljava.java_thread_pg_entry</code> PostgreSQL configuration variable,
 that may be the same one thread for the duration of a session, or it may be
 possible for one thread to relinquish that status and another thread to take
 it: for the <code>pljava.java_thread_pg_entry</code> setting <code>allow</code>, the
 status is represented by holding the object monitor on
 <code>Backend.THREADLOCK</code>, and <code>Backend.threadMayEnterPG()</code> returns
 true for whatever thread holds it. Under that setting, there can be moments
 when <code>Backend.threadMayEnterPG()</code> is not true for any thread, if one
 has released the monitor and no other thread has yet acquired it. For brevity
 in what follows, "the PG thread" will be used to mean whatever thread, at a
 given moment, would observe <code>Backend.threadMayEnterPG()</code> to return
 true.
<p>
 Some methods of <code>DualState</code> and subclasses may be called from any Java
 thread, while some must be called from the PG thread. The life-cycle
 callbacks, <code>javaStateReleased</code>, <code>javaStateUnreachable</code>, and
 <code>nativeStateReleased</code>, are called by the implementation, and always
 on the PG thread.
<p>
 The Java Memory Model imposes strict conditions for updates to memory state
 made in one thread to be visible to other threads. Methods that are known to
 be called only on the PG thread can sidestep those complexities, at least
 to the extent that they manipulate only data structures not accessed in other
 threads. This is true even under the <code>pljava.java_thread_pg_entry</code>
 setting <code>allow</code>, where "the PG thread" may not always be the same
 thread. Because a Java synchronization event is involved whenever
 "the PG thread" changes, unbroken visibility is assured, just as it would be
 in one unchanging thread, so one can say "the PG thread" for convenience and
 without loss of generality.
<p>
 For the <code>nativeStateReleased</code> lifecycle event, rules for memory
 visibility are not enough; a mechanism for mutual exclusion is needed. The
 callback is made on the PG thread from PostgreSQL code that is in the process
 of invalidating the native state, and will do so once the callback returns.
 If any other Java thread is actively referring to that native state, there is
 no choice but to block the PG thread making the callback until such other
 threads are no longer relying on the native state.
<p>
 To that end, the <a href="#pin()"><code>pin</code></a> and <a href="#unpin()"><code>unpin</code></a> methods are
 provided, and must be used to surround any block of code that accesses the
 native state:
<pre>
pin();
try
{
    ... code that dereferences or relies on
    a valid native state ...
}
finally
{
    unpin();
}
</pre>
<p>
 Pins are lightweight, nonexclusive (any number of threads may simultaneously
 pin the same <code>DualState</code> instance), and reentrant (a single thread may
 obtain and release nested pins on the same instance). The code protected by a
 pin is ideally a short sequence representing a simple operation (reading a
 value, or refilling a small buffer with data) on the native state. The chief
 purpose of holding a pin is to hold off the possible invalidation of the
 native state until the pin is released.
<p>
 If either the native state or the Java state has been released already (by
 the resource owner callback or an explicit call to <code>releaseFromJava</code>,
 respectively), <code>pin()</code> will detect that and throw the appropriate
 exception. Otherwise, the state is safe to make use of until <code>unpin</code>.
 A subclass can customize the messages or <code>SQLSTATE</code> codes for the
 exceptions <code>pin()</code> may throw, by overriding one or more of
 <a href="#identifierForMessage()"><code>identifierForMessage</code></a>,
 <a href="#invalidMessage()"><code>invalidMessage</code></a>,
 <a href="#releasedMessage()"><code>releasedMessage</code></a>,
 <a href="#invalidSqlState()"><code>invalidSqlState</code></a>, or
 <a href="#releasedSqlState()"><code>releasedSqlState</code></a>.
<p>
 Code that holds a pin may safely act on components of the native state from
 any thread, so long as the actions do not include native calls to PostgreSQL
 routines (directly or transitively). Access to the native memory through a
 direct byte buffer would be a permitted example, or even calls to JNI methods
 to retrieve fields from C <code>struct</code>s or chase pointers through a data
 structure, as long as only thread-safe routines from the C runtime are called
 and no routines of PostgreSQL itself, and as long as the memory or structure
 being accessed is known to be safe from modification by PostgreSQL while the
 pin is held. In the future, PL/Java may one day have an annotation that can
 be used to mark native methods that satisfy these limits; at present, there
 has been no effort to segregate them into those that do and those that don't.
 Native methods that may (under any circumstances!) invoke PG routines must
 be invoked on the PG thread.
<p>
 The exclusive counterparts to <code>pin</code> and <code>unpin</code> are
 <a href="#lock(boolean)"><code>lock</code></a> and <a href="#unlock(int,boolean)"><code>unlock</code></a>, which are not
 expected to be used as widely. The chief use of <code>lock</code>/<code>unlock</code>
 is around the call to <code>nativeStateReleased</code> when handling a resource
 owner callback from PostgreSQL. They can be used in subclasses to surround
 modifications to the state, as needed. A <code>lock</code> will block until all
 earlier-acquired pins are released; subsequent pins block until the lock is
 released. Only the PG thread may use <code>lock</code>/<code>unlock</code>. An
 <code>upgrade</code> argument to <code>lock</code> allows the lock to be acquired
 when the PG thread already holds a pin; it should be specified
 only when inspection of the code identifies a nearby enclosing pin and
 confirms that the planned locked actions will not break the pinning code's
 assumptions. Pins can be freely acquired by the PG thread while it holds a
 lock; the coding convention's strict nesting assures they will all be
 released before the lock is.
<p>
 In an explicit call to <code>releaseFromJava</code>, which may be made from any
 thread, the instance is immediately, atomically, flagged as released. No
 subsequent pin will succeed. Pins already held are unaffected, so there must
 be no changes made to the state, at the time <code>releaseFromJava</code> is
 called, that could confuse any code that already holds a pin and is relying
 on the state. Such changes must be made in the <code>javaStateReleased</code>
 callback, which will execute only after release of the last pin, if any, and
 always on the PG thread. If the last pin is released by a thread other than
 the PG thread, the callback does not execute immediately, but via a queue
 that is polled from the PG thread at convenient points.
<p>
 Instances whose referents are found unreachable by Java's garbage collector
 are placed on the same queue, so their <code>javaStateUnreachable</code> callbacks
 will be executed on the PG thread when the queue is polled. The callbacks
 should clean up any lingering native state.
<p>
 As the callbacks are executed on the PG thread, any native calls they may
 need to make into PostgreSQL are allowed without extra ceremony.
<p>
 There are different abstract subclasses of <code>DualState</code> that wrap
 different sorts of PostgreSQL native state, and encapsulate what needs to be
 done when such state is released from the Java or native side. More such
 subclasses can be added as needed.
<p>
 A client class of <code>DualState</code> will typically contain a static nested
 class that further extends one of these abstract subclasses, and the client
 instance will hold a strong reference to an instance of that
 <code>DualState</code> subclass constructed at the same time.
<p>
 <strong>This class uses some private data structures, to track
 created instances through their life cycles, that are not synchronized or
 thread-safe.</strong> The design rests on the following requirements:
 <ul>
 <li>The structures are only traversed or modified during:
  <ul>
  <li>Instance construction
  <li>Reference queue processing (instances found unreachable by Java's
  garbage collector, or enqueued following <code>releaseFromJava</code>)
  <li>Exit of a resource owner's scope
  </ul>
 <li>There is only one PG thread, or only one at a time.
 <li>Construction of any <code>DualState</code> instance is to take place only on
 the PG thread. The requirement to pass any
 constructor a <code>DualState.Key</code> instance, obtainable by native code, is
 intended to reinforce that convention. It is not abuse-proof, or intended as
 a security mechanism, but only a guard against programming mistakes.
 <li>Reference queue processing takes place only at chosen points where a
 thread enters or exits native code, on the PG thread.
 <li>Resource-owner callbacks originate in native code, on the PG thread.

 This should not be called directly. When Java code has called
 <code>releaseFromJava</code>, the state will be changed to 'released'
 immediately, though without actually disturbing any state that might be
 referenced by threads with existing pins. This method will be called
 at some later time, always on a thread able to enter PG, and with no
 other threads having the native state pinned, so this is the place for
 any actual release of native state that may be needed.

 If the <code>nativeStateLive</code> parameter is false, this method must avoid
 any action (such as freeing) it would otherwise take on the associated
